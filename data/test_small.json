News about them on Reddit get suppressed too !", "text": " Your entire profile is just about posting anti india stuff. Its really hilarious how Pakistanis keep spamming this and trying their best to potray the situation as another Hong kong thing. Also the lock down will be over once the situation is properly solved. The removal of article 370 is a big deal and it will take for things to settle down. Besides that terrorist activities are at an all time high right now (thanks to your country). Also the entire world knows that Pakistan is a joke in regards of human rights. Speaking of human rights could you please tell me what happened to the hindu majority which now has been turned into the minority ? Children are literally being handed weapons for jihad instead of proper education. This genuinely makes me sick. I am only worried those kashmiris who can't live their normal lives like a common human being just because of this entire mess. As usual I got attack by plenty of Indians.... and they ask me why did I create a new account. They dont look like Kashmiri people though I don't thinks it's reddit suppressing these posts, it's just the sheer number of Indian on here who down vote all Kashmir related posts. What is happening on our earth right now?? Delete this. I even made a post that proved my point by going into controversial [here]( You know I browse reddit all the time and I'm always seeing people post pictures of protest going on in there country and then they say no one is talking about it. Maybe it's because their are so many protest going on around the world that it's hard to keep track of it all because it just gets collected with all the other protest that is happening.I'm just a simple dude trying to survive in my world so wtf do you want me to do about it? Lmao. I love how you just straight away attacked me and assumed Im Pakistani. I really dont give a fuck about pakistan. I care about the Kashmiris.  I also wont believe any of Indian propaganda.  Youre right though. It isnt like HK. Its worse. Those poor people have no way to ask for help since the indian army is fucking em over there and blocking em from the rest of the world.  I also dont care about religion. But if you wanna turn it into that. Modi is known to like killing muslims. He was banned from the US because of that after all. Ps: you can read my post on why Im using a throwaway. When you have people like you that dig through peoples account just to attack them and cant take criticism.  Took bad it didnt workout for you.

As a math textbook editor, I can tell you its super misleading to show this one problem out of context. These students have undoubtedly been taught something like this: 8 + 5 = 8 + 2 + 3 = 10 + 3 = 13. That type of decomposition is a very standard arithmetic strategy. (Ive been using it since way before Common Core was a thing,) The teachers response should be understood in the context of the work the class has been doing.Could students figure out 8 + 5 without that strategy? Sure. But they learn the strategy now so they can use it in much more advanced math problems later.In general, please dont leap to conclusions about something without considering what the context may be. 10 = 8+5-3 What the shit. That is how I work the problem, and that is one badly-worded un-question. I'm almost thirty and this is how my mom taught me to do arithmetic.

Just about everything you said is completely inaccurate   [ The British developed rubber roundsthe \"Round, Anti-Riot, 1.5in Baton\"in 1970 for use against people in [Northern Ireland]( A low power propelling charge gave them a muzzle velocity of about 60 m/s (200 ft/s) and maximum range of about 100 m (110 yd). The intended use is to fire at the ground so that the round bounces up and hits the target on the legs, causing pain but not injury.[\\[11\\]]( From 1970 to 1975, about 55,000 rubber bullets were fired by the British Army in Northern Ireland.[\\[8\\]]( Often they were fired directly at people from close range, which resulted in three people being killed and many more badly injured.[\\[8\\]]( In 1975, they were replaced by [plastic bullets]( In Northern Ireland over 35 years (19702005), about 125,000 rubber and plastic bullets were firedan average of ten per daycausing 17 deaths.[\\[12\\]](The baton round was made available to British police forces outside Northern Ireland from 2001. In 2013 however, [Ministry of Defence]( papers declassified from 1977 revealed it was aware rubber bullets were more dangerous than was publicly disclosed. The documents contained legal advice for the [MoD]( to seek a settlement over a child who had been blinded in 1972, rather than go to court which would expose problems with the bullets and make it harder to fight future related cases. The papers stated that further tests would reveal serious problems with the bullets, including that they were tested \"in a shorter time than was ideal\", that they \"could be lethal\" and that they \"could and did cause serious injuries\".[\\[13\\]]([Israeli]( rubber bullets are produced in two main types. The older type, the standard rubber bullet, is a steel sphere coated in a thin layer of rubber, weighing 14 grams, while the newly improved rubber bullet, introduced in 1989, is a rubber-coated metal cylinder 1.7  cm in diameter, weighing 15.4 grams.[\\[14\\]]( Of the lethal injuries from this projectile, most are suffered to the head.[\\[14\\]](", "image_hash": "hb5wt76s4w331.png", "id": "bzoudx"}, {"caption": "Sharing My Art #13", "text": " This is gorgeous!

This photo was not modified in any way, apart from Autobalance applied to the entire photo using Microsoft Photo Editor. The reflections are exactly as we saw them, which is what made the scene so amazing. So this is NOT a \"Photoshopped\" picture. You are right; the building on the right should be cropped. There is a story to this shot. My friend and I drove up from New Jersey to the Finger Lakes in NY for three days of photography. Unfortunately, the weather was absolutely atrocious, with a dense fog all three days, so we did not get much in terms of foliage shots. On the drive home, both of us very depressed at our wasted trip, and lack of success, we saw a sign that said ?Lakeview?, and decided to take a detour. Just then the light got slightly better. Unfortunately while attempting to park by the roadside, we ended up in a deep leaf-covered muddy ditch, and had to make several calls for help. We were eventually towed out by a Good Samaritan. A few minutes later, we took our shots of the lake. We are pleased that we did get some good foliage shots from what had initially appeared to be a wasted trip. The moral of this story? - seize every photo opportunity you get! Often what turns out best is not what you had planned. Thanks again!

What kind of micro gravity is supposed to exist on the iss exactly? Almost looks like an LED. Guess that's why they don't use candles as a light source on the ISS. I love how much this show pays attention to detail. The shot of Miller pouring a drink on Ceres is another fun one (if not perfectly accurate). Educated guess here: blue flame is more complete/hotter combustion (this part is fact); since the material isnt floating away (theres no up for convection so it just globs together), the material spends more time in the heat and is able to fully combust. From what I recall, and if memory holds true, from this being introduced a while back: When a candle is lit and the flame expands the gas around it, the heated air becomes less dense than the cooler air around it. Since the gravity of the Earth pulls the denser air downward, it causes the less dense heated air to \"rise\". Since there is no gravity on the ISS or in space, the less dense, expanding gas doesn't really have anywhere to go but outward so forms a ball.", "image_hash": "r5or4k2iank41.jpg", "id": "fdbxn5"}, {"caption": "My band wrapped up our mini tour from Atlanta to Denton this weekend .

She uses natural henna leaf powder, water, sugar and lavender essential oil in her mix. How do I know? Aside from knowing her personally, theres a few thinks you can look for. the image appears dark, but raised. And where the light shines on it, the design has a green sheen and is obviously puffy. This indicates this is a photo of the design with the paste on. A black henna design will appear dark, but flat in both texture and sheen. It will also be a bitch blacker black than this image. An experienced artist can tell the difference almost immediately. Now how do you know if your henna is safe? I tell my clients to look for three things. 1) ask to smell it! Henna should smell like a spa day. 2) ask to see the paste. It should be a medium green, and if you squeeze a little on your fingers you can rub it and feel fine plant matter. It wont be slick and it wont stain immediately. 3) ask about the stain. Henna will start out bright orange and end up dark reddish brown. This is super important. Anything that stains within minutes and starts dark is not safe for your skin. People in places like Venice beach and tourist traps often use hair dye- black or brown- because of the quick stain and because a lot of people want the black stain. It isnt safe. It isnt natural. It isnt henna. Henna is perishable as well, so avoid henna cones that have been sitting on a store shelf.  Its best to mix your own!Edit- I was a little unclear above. Black henna is what causes scars and internal organ damage. Its awful stuff, but its not Henna. Its actually hair dye! Real henna is very safe. And beautiful. And has a long history across a huge part of the world including North Africa, Southern Europe, the Middle East and South Asia. Cheers all! For those wondering if this was the organic henna or the chemical henna that causes burns and such i have taken a look at her instagram and can pretty much say it looks natural and not like the chemical trash you find at tourists sites aint black henna causing cancer?
