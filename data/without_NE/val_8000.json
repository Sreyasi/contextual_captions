A facebook status would have been easier. Not gonna diss either party here, but this screams of redneck Why are the uneducated so obsessed with Trump? heres a list. its actually not bad:  You think only the uneducated like Trump? I guess were all deplorables right. How can you support someone who is so hateful, mean-spirited, and racist? Those don't seem like educated views to me. He says ignorant things on a daily basis, and you're okay with it? Hes an outsider, Washington despises an outsider who wont play by the old boy rules. The msm hates him because that is what the theyre told to do. The uneducated as you refer to his supporters are the same people who fix your plumbing and electric, operate refineries and chemical plants and build homes. Just because they dont buy into the bullshit peddled by the MSM doesnt make them stupid or uneducated. The biggest news story to come out is glossed over because the Democrats want to try and impeach him , but it wont happen especially with the likes of aoc and her Gang of Four. The worldwide pedophile ring ran by Epstein should by the biggest story but they wont even touch it and if fact downplay it calling the underage female children, underage women. You go ahead and hate him, thats your choice but hes going to be president again in 2020. So, you're okay with the fact that he's a misogynistic rapist? That's cool. Just because someone denies something doesn't mean it's not true. If you had raped someone, you would deny it, too, unless you have a moral backbone. I'm assuming you don't since you support a man who was best friends with Epstein at one point and proudly brags about grabbing them by the pussy. Also, of course, we're talking about Epstein. I've seen entire news programs on both types of partisan news channels devoted to that story.That's just one of the many reasons I don't care for him. I don't hate anyone. It's too much energy, and it hurts me more than anyone else. Also, he spreads enough hate for the whole world. I refuse to buy into his schtick.

Suicidal people also know how to use Google.

You know what totally plays into that? Anyone who tells you how much value you have without even knowing you exist.

Im also a smoker, but people flicking their butts everywhere really pisses me off. I know its just burnt leaves, but the tabs arent and take forever to disintegrate, unless purposefully biodegradable; and even then just stub it out and put it in a bin  For all I know, youve never cleaned up any cigarettes and just took a picture of dirt. Thats a great thing to do pity more people are not like you, Well done!. I always throw mine in the garbage can ash tray, or in the actual bin if they dont have a tray, after making sure theyre actually out ofc. You could use an old cigarillo case thats what I do! You can get some cheap brand ones that are actually decent enough to smoke for less than 10 bucks. Edit: no clue what happened, I hit the reply button lol Thanks.  Had some fuckstick flick his unfinished butt ONTO my car at a stoplight the other day.  Landed in the windshield wiper cavity...fkng furious. I do this too!  I've stopped consuming hard narcotics and been clean a long time, but unfortunately I did pick up the habit of smoking 3-4 cigarettes a day.  And I thought as a cig smoker, we are all one people who understand each other - yet I can't understand how some just litter their butts everywhere, it makes us all look bad.  So I have a little butt bag and everywhere I go I try and pick up as many butts as I can.Sometimes, if I'm in San Francisco I only pick them up if their on nature - because thats like a zombie invasion, pick one up, another three get dropped.

I feel like the attention to detail like decorative carvings like this can make a place really feel homey.  What kind of stone is that? Looks like its inverted. Really cool levelling! Thank you.

A tip I hear when building is to make the entrance as low as possible as they are pretty good at trapping body heat! This is awesome! I remember building one with my dad, we made individual bricks for ours. All the snow everywhere had melted but that igloo stayed for weeks. It was nice & warm in it too, ya wouldnt think so. Nice job on yours!! I've made 2 attempts at igloos. One was barely big enough for me to scrunch up in, and I never completed the other.They are *VERY* labor intensive! Not bad. Where in the world does it snow that much for a beautiful abode like that? I'm in northern Denmark and we don't even have that much snow yet....  #bitterness My neighbor and I used to do this (not this quality) whenever we got a big snow when we were young, and it ended when I left her to die to go find a parent when we were maybe 8-9 years old.  We had a huge storm, like 3 feet, and dug this magnificent palace, we had hot chocolate in it, it was fantastic for days.  Then one day it collapsed on us, somehow I was closer to the entrance and got out.  So tiny me's brain said go get a parent, so left this girl to suffocate.  She's fine, but that ended our igloo building days real fast, both sets of parents screaming \"OMG WHERE IS SHE\" and I had to explain she's somewhere at the bottom of that giant snowbank. Looks awesome! I want to see the inside of it as a Floridian i am incredibly jealous!! this looks like so much fun  I'm jealous you have enough snow to do that. It's a brown Christmas for us.

Too bad they are closing down, many restaurants have converted to to-go only and are offering special to-go menus.Hope you all get back to work soonest!

Good God.  I hope it's chlorinated and filtered.  I don't think I'd go near it otherwise&#x200B; Szechenyi Bath House in Budapest. One of the biggest natural hot springs in Europe.  No this was just the main bath at the Szechenyi Bath in  Budapest. Have a read up on it if you havent heard of it.   It was more so the architecture, time of year, company I took with me and how it was 1 degree outside but 30 odd in the water. My experience was pleasant. Dont know about everybody elses.

I shot quite a bit with an FM2 in high school, ~1988. Mine was the black version tho. Good camera. From there I upgraded to the venerable F3. Fun times. Thanks for reminding me. Classic I found these when I went to Italy after my grandfather passed away a few years ago, he had a lot of photography items! No problem :) Luckily my grandfather (born in 1940 something) is still alive. I learned about his photo equipment when I was around 10 and ever since that day all of it was mine. Over the years I learned how to use it to a certain amount.Unfortunately the old man never spent too much money on stuff like this so all the cams are average at best. Still love every single one! What a wonderful story! I wish my grandfather had developed the film he had because it expired in 2004 so that sucks but its still amazing equipment to look at! Learn to use it if you don't already. Also try and get the film developed by a proper photostudio anyways. Sure it may cost a lot but it is however possible that they can rescue some of it. I would call \"worth it\" any day and IF there is only one pic on all of those its sure to be a special one (to you at least). If you do so please share <3 Ill let you know if I do <3 Looking forward to it. Even if it is expired: Once it was used and properly rewinded AND put back in those boxes and kept in this bag (unless in an unsafe place like say near a window or something) they should be more or less ok.

So far I'm loving it. There are a lot of different sides to it, and a LOT of safety focus. No worries! Yeah, offshore wind farms. 11 turbines on this one, small site. One of the bigger ones we have,  has 91 turbines, and there are still bigger farms around.  I am currently  offshore, on the turbine. We have some generator issues, so i got time to reply.We work 12 hour days. Sail out in the morning, go home when we're done or have to go in. Sail out again the next day, provided the weather allows it. Can't have too high waves or too much wind, as we can't crane stuff up if it's too bad. On this site, we live in a hotel on shore. Some sites you stay on a hotel ship or a hotel platform Off the Coast of the UK.Essentially, standing top of 3 vacuum suction cups, sucked stuck to the seabed What kind of training do you have to have?I love schedules like that. wow, thanks for the reply. I was just super curious how that all worked. Wasn't sure if the turbines had like a barracks area, etc. I assume this is considered more of a dangerous job? Loads.Enhanced first aid, working at Height, Sea Survival, advanced rescue, and those are just some of the safety courses you need. Professionel training, i am personally a Marine Engineer. We also have electricians, mechanical engineers etc. Oh yeah, definitely. I have literally had to sign a document that, in the event of my death, the person i write on this paper gets a monetary \"sorry he died\" payout.."}, {"id": "a6u6os", "caption": "No matter how cool you are  , you'll never be elephant taking your selfie cool  .", "image_hash": "KxA77Zm.jpg", "text": " Call me skeptical. Someone could feeding the elephant and taking the picture.Edit: Since this is currently top comment, I'm going to redirect people to this comment describing how this elephant is being abused - Never noticed those chains hanging from it's mouth.Edit: Apparently chains don't necessarily mean the animal is being abused. I don't know what to believe anymore but I think we can agree that abuse is bad. Since this is being seen by lots of people, maybe we can help spread some facts around about these photos.Look closely at the picture and you can see chains hanging from the Elephant's mouth. Elephants in this kind of captivity are generally horribly abused. Elephants are intelligent and social animals and the captors provide the bare minimum to keep them alive. They are whipped and treated like slaves. Do some basic research and you'll learn about it.When you see these pictures, downvote them and comment on them about the facts. When your friends on fb post them, educate them that they are supporting very bad practices. When you go to places like SE Asia, do your research. There are some elephant sanctuaries that let you bathe the elephants and they are treated well. Support THOSE ones. No matter how cool you are, you'll never be someone who had a trained animal do a thing it's done for hundreds of tourists cool. How many lashes with a barbed cane does it take to train an elephant to do that?  Am I the only one who sees the chains hanging from its mouth? Heartbreak  Guarantee the handler is taking the photo and handing the elephant something just off camera. Hell I'd put money on it.

There are species called hawks in more than one genus, Accipitrinae and Buteo, which makes it a bit confusing.In the Americas, members of the Buteo genus are also called hawks; this group are called buzzards in other parts of the world. Generally, buteos have broad wings and sturdy builds. They are relatively larger-winged, shorter-tailed and fly further distances in open areas than accipiters. Buteos descend or pounce on their prey rather than hunting in a fast horizontal pursuit.OP's photo, being taken in the UK, is most likely (I'm about 90% certain) of a Common Buzzard (Buteo Buteo).Edit: Changed to Latin name of Accipiter gemus Thats the one.

Ive always been fascinated with turgor pressure in plants.   Yes and no I vote yes. I just love strawberries.  Not sure what that is, but I like the sound of it...  Same  Turgor pressure is what makes a droopy plant stand upright after you water it. Its caused by osmosis, the cool process where water will move between membranes on its own until it is equally distributed in all areas. In this case when the cells at the bottom of the plant have full access to water, it will slowly move up through all the cells until even the ones at the top are full.  Once the plant has all the cells full they can transpire. They open tiny little windows on the leaves (called stomates or stomata) to let some water out and let in some carbon dioxide.  Think of it like if you were to burn something in the kitchen and open a window to let the smoke out, some fresh air would come in too. Transpiration is the process that helps trees reduce flooding and houseplants increase indoor humidity.  They take water from the soil around the roots and push it into the atmosphere.  The droplets shown on the leaves are an example of water moving via osmosis up through the plant cells from the roots to the stomates where they are released through transpiration.  If you put a plastic bag over a leaf in the sun youll get condensation inside the bag as the leave absorbs CO2 and releases water.   Thanks, appreciate the time taken to reply and explain it.I took some botany, but clearly not enough! It's amazing how complex even \"simple\" plants are and how people take them for granted.

It's almost like because they're just 3% it's easier to draw lines where you wish. Fuck them right?  We can ignore the broad majority of people in prison are impoverished only when we're talking about black incarceration rates. White people in jail are just criminals who deserve to be there and may not have had the advantages needed to avoid a life of crime as far as education and employment.  Although apparently that doesn't apply to blacks  They make up 10% of Canada's prison population so they must just be in inherently evil race.Freedom of speech.   Using rhetoric to bring people together. Mmmmmmmh Whites commit less crime thank blacks. Its a majority within blacks. In the states, 13% of the population (blacks) commit 56% of the crime. Whites commit much less. 1 in 3 blacks will be incarcerated in their lifetime. Its definitely their culture, whites are less violent. tuuuuuw Tell that to the exploding white domestic abuse stats. >. Whites commit much less. It's funny you say that.  This chart from the FBI:UCR Shows whites leading in rape, \"violent crime\", larceny and vagrancy with blacks following behind with a large gap in numbers. It's almost like you're trying to make a point without using all the data. Like it's easier just to condemn black people and dust off your hands while ignoring a shit ton of white crime. Blacks kill each other at a staggering rate. Almost all black murder is committed by a blacks person.

Would you feed your dog a frozen treat? A must visit!> APRIL 13, 2017 looks like he's having a good time I saved this as my computer background, it's just so heartwarming. I had an old picture of my dog that looked similar, and I lost the photo so this reminds me of the moment. &#x200B;I was taking my dog for a walk around the block on a hot Virginia morning, and an ice cream truck went by. I got him a strawberry shortcake, and he was in paradise. &#x200B;Thanks for reminding me of that moment! Anyone else getting Pacha vibes from this pup? for a second i didnt see the human hand and thought the dog was holding the cone \"Are you gonna finish that?\" [Woofy Montana]( My grandmother had that look on her face, when had what was to be her last ice-cream one week before she died  she was 81 years old.

You've spent X dollars and it took you X hours to get there, just to throw crap on the ground? Good for you! I went to an unofficial local gun range, and as these things tend to go, its become a dumping ground of random appliances that people dumped and shot at. I would love to do something like you did and go haul it all out! Youve inspire me! The cig butts kill me every time. Today I watched a woman open her car door on the highway offramp to put out her cigarette...and then just leave it right on the ground. People throw those things out as if it's their God given right to just dispose of them wherever they please like its a crumb of a cookie or something. It thoroughly disgusts me. None of us want to see little yellow or white filters that have been sucked upon, all over our roads, pathways, lawns, sidewalks, beaches, etc. People...do better. I try to live by take out more than you brought in.  I come home from a hike,  pack and pockets are full of trash.  Every little bit helps. Dog poop, too. On the popular trails. Please. Thank you, kind sir/madam! Reminds me of the garbage my wife and I brought down from the top of Diamond Peak here in Oregon. Just why? Why do people feel it's ok to leave garbage in such a remote place? It's not going anywhere, nothing lives up there. It would have sat there uglifying the scenery forever if someone with a bit of sense didn't come along and clean up after those lazy slobs. It's the cigarettes that piss me off the most. Any one of those could have started a fire when it hit the ground. We used to go hiking a bunch here in Oregon.  But increasingly, people are just selfish pigs.  Cigarette butts, plastic water bottles.   Plastic bags of dogshit tied to branches(?@$#$@) or just left on the ground.  On one trip, some assclown in flip-flops was strolling along a crowded spot playing guitar badly and singing even worse, as if everyone wanted to hear him.

I take anti psychotic medication for schizoaffective disorder. I havent had a psychotic thought ever since. I am afraid though to tell people this especially future romantic partners.

May everyone who needs medication be able to afford it and only have side effects that are beneficial to them if any. amen As someone who takes an anti-psychotic as well as an antidepressant every day, I love this PSA. I live a mostly normal, stable life thanks to my medication. Stop the stigma. For some reason I read this as I take every anti-psychotic medication everyday and I was like alright damn but good for you girl keep on living your best life. Only Cthulhu can judge her. I have a family member who wouldn't be able to leave a mental ward without her meds. With them she is pretty much normal. I learned alot about mental health because of her situation.

Unfortunately it'll never get any traction on r/pics against the sea of dogs and selfies. The photographer wrote this about the photo:This photograph was created on Cyprus. In old port streets of Limassol. I was taking some pictures of a boy playing wooden flute when this cat come to see what's going on. It was just for a second or two but it looks like the cat could listen for that flute for hours. I really like the feeling of quietude and peace on this photo. Hope you'll appreciate it too. So cute! Isn't this the album cover of an edm song? I thought it was lalala but it wasn't. Anyone here that knows? This makes me wonder. I started playing g guitar a couple years ago, and whenever I go in the basement to play my dog will always follow me, sir, and listen to me play.

Once in place, take a picture for the police as evidence then ask him to leave politely. If he doesnt comply shit uncontrollably until he has to vacate the room for air. Call the police again and tell them he's black. I...want to believe this is real. Let's see where this goes.

He helped topple Gaddafi after he capitulated to our demands. He let an oil corporate assault natives in their own land and pollute their water for profit.Expanded our private prison industry for cheap slave labor. Was against gay marriage until it was politically inconvenient for him in 2012Kept weed illegal. Criminalizing people for what they put in their own bodies.

Thats the finished side that is designed to do the cleaning and theres no practical way to fold / use that texture with it installed this way. Also, this way is susceptible to kids and pets spinning it off the role. The way it was drawn in the patent application was necessary, to illustrate the perforations and had little or nothing to do with practicality and usage. Just sayin : ) What's particularly irritating here is that this specific type of dispenser is one of few that actually works better if you put the roll on backwards. The way it is in the picture, it tries to pull against the wall and creates extra friction. If you put it on backwards it tries to pull out away from the wall and works much easier.

What used to be considered a hole in the sky is now known to astronomers as a dark molecular cloud. Here, a high concentration of dust and molecular gas absorb practically all the visible light emitted from background stars. The eerily dark surroundings help make the interiors of molecular clouds some of the coldest and most isolated places in the universe. One of the most notable of these dark absorption nebulae is a cloud toward the constellation Ophiuchus known as Barnard 68, pictured here. That no stars are visible in the center indicates that Barnard 68 is relatively nearby, with measurements placing it about 500 light-years away and half a light-year across. It is not known exactly how molecular clouds like Barnard 68 form, but it is known that these clouds are themselves likely places for new stars to form. In fact, Barnard 68 itself has been found likely to collapse and form a new star system. It is possible to look right through the cloud in infrared light. It's like a shadow in the warp. I'm sure it's nothing, just a gas cloud, a bunch of dust... nothing to worry about. It's cool that you can see the stars shit towards red as they get deeper in the cloud.   With this being a Dark Molecular cloud aside, I recently found out that Milky Way (our home) is located [inside the single largest void we know of to date.](  While most of the rest of the universe is pretty uniform with how galaxies are spread out, our galaxy (besides our neighbor Andromeda) are really only the few for hundreds of millions of light years. Pretty eerie.  That's where it lives. Prepare yourselves.....  They...are...Coming....... Boot  This is of course not a star-eating entity roaming the large voids in search of prey.

That's gotta suck but I must ask.  Is it the only day you pay attention to her? probably could have just said that. no, not at all. she carries the same attitude with any visit I make to her, I think she has it in here mind that my visiting her is seen like a task or a job.  I've really tried to love her, but with every visit she brings up every wrong that has been done to her throughout my life, and the lives of my family, something that has nothing to do with me.  she then proceeds to get violent & angry at my wanting to rebuild the family, a family that she supposedly wants. but shows no effort to do so.and so any holiday, birthday, mother's , Thanksgiving or even Christmas she explodes into anger about her life's misgivings. ( which by the way are only her self manufactured emotional damage ) with every meeting & magnified holiday meeting, we are pushed further and further away ( immediate family ) she's happy go lucky with strangers and so my being raised in this environment has created my distaste for holidays.

And if you dont breathe right you wind up taking in some CO2. Even the weight. Doesnt feel heavy but it pulls your head forward and just a tiny bit of weight really weighs on your neck/posture. Note sure what filters you have on but the ones I had lasts like 100 hours, so hope you had it in a sealed bag...I did not .. and not when I need it for paint and grinding stuff you can't find anything because of the Corona .. even dusts masks are all out So I found the model I have, the respirator alone without filter cartridges provides alot of protection and is reusable many times. I will be talking to a friend of mine who is an ICU nurse to see if I can donate it. They need it more than I do. [ Agree I don't care what the site says it is not \"comfortable\" and the tension to keep the mask sealed against you nose and mouth does cause neck pain after awhile.But that is better than being under-protected and at risk. I'm not sure either, I bought it because paint fumes make me sick and it was months back. I didn't remove them and seal them if that's what you are asking. I would think the life of the filter would be based on usage, similar to a household filter but I should have read the instructions if its only good for a period of time once its activated. The center mask on its own has decent filters without the meth lab grade cartridges on the side. I read up on that a couple of weeks ago , I'm guessing if they lay open they will circulate air through them then If there are in a bag it won't Well I don't feel like it is designed to begin with to protect against/filter out biological agents. You would think but since I had them attached to the mask and not seal the filters are probably not good on them anymore. Honestly I would rather donate it to medical professionals, though im not sure if they can use it and since its been used already, if I even can I would think that air being forced back and forth through the filters would have a lot more effect on them than just sitting around exposed."}, {"id": "apguot", "caption": "Wisdom and his friends have made a living by selling flowers  , but they are happy in life  .", "image_hash": "4say1s5p8yf21.jpg", "text": " It does not appear that all of Wisdoms friends are happy...."}, {"id": "aix49e", "caption": "This bookshelf was made specifically for these books  !", "image_hash": "oepPa2pp.jpg", "text": " That's a novel concept.

I built something similar because my neighbors flood light shine right into my bedroom and refuses to do anything about it.

His neighbor accused my aunt of being a pedophile because my aunt was out on her own deck, using her new cell phone.  (This was when the first iPhone came out).The neighbor's kids were inside their house, had not been outside all day as far as my aunt knew - the neighbor just got a wild hair up her ass to the point of calling the cops because my aunt dared to be outside with a - gasp - cell phone. Things devolved from that point, leading to my uncle building a fence that blocked the neighbor's view over to their deck.  Except . . . the side that faced the neighbor had about 39 different kinds of wood tacked up in a godawful mess. Everyone is commenting on the fence height, but no one has mentioned that there's not enough post in the ground. There's 13.5-14' out of the ground leaving just 2-2.5' in the ground. You always want 1/4 to 1/3 the post length in the ground. Good wind and that's falling over.

Brendan Shaub in the back rocking his gucci flamingo pink beanie. Love his coat.  I think this is important not just from a gender side of things. Some people have no one, they are orphaned and without family, without children, without traditional loved ones. They are still somebody, and don't deserve to be excluded from respect just because they don't have a tight group of support. In fact they need it more than anyone. &#x200B; Well, the idea behind the original ideation was communicating the concept of empathy to the people who werent immediately able to experience it from the second-person perspective, so it put the subject into a referential context that could be reflected upon in the first-person by those types.The original concept wasnt depersonalizing women, it was trying to frame womens issues in a way that people who have difficulty with second-person empathy could process.This sign just kind of deconstructs back down to the idea they have difficulty processing. I mean, obviously its the better of the two ideas, but its just not as effective for some.This-Is-Getting-Out-Of-Hand Edit:Things Im doing with this comment:- Commentating on the potential marketing (awareness) effectiveness of an awareness sign in a picture I saw while browsing the internetThings Im not doing with this comment:- Defending or sympathizing with rapists (?)- Dismantling or otherwise criticizing the movement the sign was intended to support- Attempting to downplay or otherwise trivialize rape or womens issues (?)- Criticizing social awareness- Having any kind of non-marketing related issue with the dude holding the sign  Im sure hes a fine person- Supporting far right-leaning initiatives (?) I think both the original message and the message on the sign is important. You should treat people with respect and empathy, like they were a loved one, but also, recognize that people's value and dignity is not merely contingent on their relationship to other people. #What You'll Find In These Comments- The opposite of a will to live- Pain- Dissapointment- \"Ghostbusters\"- \"That guy's hot\"- \"This is a good one\"- \"This is a bad one\"- Comment summary---^(I am not a bot, beep boop.

Best time is midway between sunrise and noon, or an hour before the sunset. I thought I was in /r/aww and they have an even more specific rule about no pity posts.  Cute picture and dog, but holy fuck is it annoying seeing \"omg here is my dying friend/sibling/animal of hyperglastinoburdiferns type 3\" every other post.  Reddit is slowly making its way to the route a lot of other social media places have gone.  It's sad, I don't give a shit about reddit as a company, I just don't know where I'm going next to kill time. Oh but its a dog.  Itll get upvotes and all the comments will be sweet pupper and bestest boi. Except for all the angry responses to your comment about how its not hurting anyone, and how youre the internet police.

I lived across from Inwood hill park in NYC a couple years ago and one of my neighbors would be outside three or four times a week filling a black trash bag. I feel as though I'm pretty conscious of litter; I always crumple whatever I use and wait to dispose of it, I'll pick up a handful when on walks - but this dude went above and beyond. The most amazing thing was his attitude. I regret I never had a long conversation with him and he always greeted me slightly under his breathe so I presume a degree of shyness, I'm aware of it in myself, but whenever I would pass him picking up litter he would smile. I would be filled with murderous, defeatist rage at the prospect of picking up the same acre of park area several times a week, let's face it, from likely the same absent minded human travesties, but this guy seemed to have a real joy.

This struck a major chord with me. Having just started astrophotography, I had to capture this idea in a image, knowing that something like it had probably not been captured before, as astrophotography is a relatively new photographic genre, especially here in Africa.   Right up until the day, I had not planned to capture the moment with a father and his son, but knew I wanted a shot with a Maasai warrior in the setting of his home. The idea to include a child with his father came when we were waiting for the sun to set. The young boys were herding cattle back to their manyattas, and I guess it just hit me. Why not capture a moment between a father and son?

They all look like unpleasant people for different reasons This guy was a large influence on the early street-photography of a very young Stanley Kubrick.  In order to \"pay Weegee back\" for helping him to develop his aesthetic, Kubrick eventually hired him to be his on-set behind-the-scenes documentary photographer when he made **Dr. Strangelove**.  And Peter Sellers found Fellig's voice so interesting that he modeled the title character's voice after it. You don't see any irony in that?   He used a police radio to be on scene before anybody else  and was possibly the inspiration for the movie \"night crawler\"   Not so much that movie.  That tactic's standard video \"stringer\" *modus operandi*.  But Fellig *was* the inspiration for this Joe Pesci movie:  **The Public Eye**:   Either way, street photography is fine art at it's best   It sure can be.  Weegee was the master of cropping his images to create a heartbreaking or meaning-packed narrative.Have you ever seen his photo \"Their First Murder\"?

Then you need to reverse the role and tell the parental unit that it's too dangerous for you to help. And then go help.

Do you know what VMAQ is? I'm assuming it was an aircraft carrier prowler unit? I'm extremely lacking in knowledge about military patches and their purpose.

Marine Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron.  The Prowlers were electronic intelligence and RADAR jamming planes. We were Marines, but we did serve on various carriers.  I was on the USS Midway in the Persian Gulf during the hostage crisis in 1979/1980. Well officially, the Marine Corps doesnt wear unit patches.  But in reality and especially when deployed this isnt always true.  Air crews for example will wear patches backed with Velcro so they can remove them before missions. Generally, yes they identify your unit. What you do. Where youve been. But in the Marines, they are unofficial. Many wear them on civilian clothes, jackets for example.Edit.

His struggle is man's struggle. He lifts my spirit. He is a loathsome, offensive brute. Yet I can't look away. Hey good for you. I bet this made your day huh My first reaction was \"huh\", but then I remember that art is really anything that can get people talking and I feel like in that measure this is a tremendous success.  Also, it seems to be very well done so there's that as well. I weirdly love this Its weird but I think it looks great there. What a conversation piece! That reminds me, I killed one last night. Fucker was on the toilet seat, when I lifted the lid. Caught me by surprise. The cockroach, I mean.  So I flicked him into the bowl of death. He tried to scramble up the side in a panic, but there was no escape. Not this time.  The rim prevented such a thing to happen, not unlike the cold ocean waters and current prevented the prisoners of Alcatraz from escaping.  No, this cockroach was no Frank Morris. This was where he was gonna take his last breath.  In the meanwhile, he's walking around on the dry part of the inside of the bowl, planning his escape.  So I grabbed a small bottle of soapy water, and sprayed it on the little fucker. Actually, he was big.  Anyways, he didn't seem to like that.  He slowed down a bit, like he wasn't feeling so good. Then he started to realize he was suffocating, and got into the water for some reason, and started swimming around, and as he started panicking, he swam around faster and faster, and started flailing around like a person drowning. It wasn't a pretty site.  Then he started convulsing, and took his last gasp of air, or should I say, he tried to take his last gasp of air. He then started to make smaller and smaller convulsions, until he finally stopped moving.  Now this all happened in a span of 60 seconds.  I thought, he's one cockroach hombre who's not gonna terrorize anyone else ever again.  But he'll probably have the last laugh.  Bet he has a hundred little muthereffer's who were just born inside the walls, to carry on his legacy.  So I flushed him down the toilet, and he was never seen again.  There are some who think he may have survived.  Shit, maybe he was Frank Morris.Anyways, to make a long story short, I saw a cockroach, sprayed him with soapy water and it suffocated him.  Works on wasps too.   Nice painting too, by the way. Tell her you painted a dead cockroach and that she put the frame upsidedown Wow, that is very cool. Do you have any more work for sale?

I named him Floyd, and that made things a little less awkward.Fun fact, they don't build webs, because they don't need to trap their prey. They just chase it down. Floyd, at full-sprint, moved about as fast as I did at a brisk walking pace. Speedy little fuckers.One night, I awoke from a dead-sleep to a faint crunching sound, almost like someone was crinkling origami paper. I traced the source to the downstairs living room. I turned on the light, and there was Floyd, munching on the largest cockroach I'd ever seen. He paused, and I swear, he looked up at me and gave me the \"sup, dude\" head nod. Then he went back to eating.We were roomies for about five or six months. I went on a deployment, and when I returned, Floyd had moved out while I was gone. No note, just an empty house.I miss, you, Floyd. Hope you're doing well, buddy. Picture with better light and size comparison would help, but looks like it could be a quite common southern house spider. If the body is lacking any distinct coloration and no striping and the abdomen has lightish grayish hair, could be  A common splatter  ... which, incidentally, is the only variety I see in my house.

The white post peeking over the driver's left rear side is another distraction.  Unless you are trying to illustrate the ground clearance, the height of the camera relative to the car is too low to view the car without distortion.  The reflection of the surrounding trees in the midline of the body is another distraction, makes it look somewhat dirty.  The windows have too much reflection in them as well.  If you parked the car further away from the trees and brought the camera up to a higher angle, you could have the trees coming out of the ground, not out of the car.Some of these can be fixed by changing the camera angle, car location and the type of available light.  Other fixes require after-shooting manipulation, via Lightroom or Photoshop, like removing the distracting reflections in the windows.  There is a lot of planning that goes into successful commercial photography; simply pointing a nice camera or high pixel phone camera does not make a good photographer.  Look a commercial photos that you would like to copy, study them to see how they are distraction free, sharply focused, the colors manipulated to show the car in the most positive manner.

It got pretty annoying as it slammed itself against my window every afternoon and, also would initially scare me to death with the first loud slamming noise. I also read about the myth that that cardinals were dead love ones returning, which lead me to think someone I knew must have really disliked me. He hasnt visited me in awhile but, I hope hes okay.

Im so sorry. You could save them and open one a year.  Since you don't know what's in  them and your mother intended for you to have them this year, I truly hope that you can bring yourself to open them within the next couple of days.  I agree w what I read elsewhere on this post where someone said that she would want you to enjoy them that was the whole point and you should really consider the fact that that's what your mom probably wanted.  I don't know what happened, but I'm very very sorry for what sounds like a loss.  Merry Christmas... let us know what was in them when you do open if you feel up for sharing..Ps. ( added edit ) make sure you cut out and save the tags where she wrote hers/your name.  That is a sentimental thing you'll probably want to keep.  Sending Hugs  F How about don't open them?

Should we rule out pet dogs now to? From a BBC article couple of years ago, \" Dr Jan Schmidt-Burbach, Global Wildlife and veterinary adviser at World Animal Protection (WAP), said: \"The cruel trend of elephants used for rides and shows is growing - we want tourists to know that many of these elephants are taken from their mothers as babies, forced to endure harsh training and suffer poor living conditions throughout their life.\" Fuck OFF Pet dogs are wildlife? Are they made to give rides, do stupid tricks for $$$? As far as horses, the racing industry is notorious for abuse. Unfortunately, that doesn't stop people from attending races. Uhh Well dogs were wild too... I guess if we keep domesticating Elephants in 100 years you are ok with them being an attraction? It is fun to gamble on horses. Again, Are pet dogs an attraction? You know dog fights?Edit : if you dont here is a Wikipedia quote : Dog fighting is a type of blood sport generally defined as two or more game dogs against one another in a ring or a pit for the entertainment of the spectators or the gratification of the dogfighters, who are sometimes referred to as dogmen I know what dogfighting is. But title of the post clearly says captive wildlife attractions.  Dogfighting is horrible but is pretty much illegal everywhere and is an underground activity. Not something decent people make their pet dogs do. Whereas elephant riding or swimming with captive dolphins, i.e. commercial exploitation of captive wildlife, is legal and exists largely because of ignorant/selfish tourists. Bottom line: animal abuse in any form is horrible but some have cultural acceptance and that needs to change. I know what dogfighting is.

A close-up of the drone and iPhone:  Nobody ever drops Samsung or Huawei phone, it seems. I was once on a small bay cruise ship and this guy was trying to do footage of us with a drone but it got too far out of range and lost connection with his remote. His type of drone was designed to return to it's lift-off point and hover 4 ft above the ground. Thing is we were on a boat, so we were no longer at the lift off point. So it's hovering over the water and then a little wave came by and swallowed it. RIP to all of the drowned drones out there. Well done!  This is awesome. When getting my gear, I bought a BCD with more pockets than I actually need. I always end up finding some trash when I dive, so they have come in handy.

My 5-year-old daughter found a caterpillar in the yard and tended after it lovingly, almost obsessively until it cocooned on the BOTTOM of its enclosure instead of on a stick, and she thus learned it was a moth caterpillar instead of a butterfly caterpillar. She is terrified of moths. She full-on cried for 30 minutes at least. She vacillated between wanting to smash it and wanting to take it far away before it could emerge. Anytime she wasnt directly looking at it, she was afraid that the moth was out and going to get her. Then...she decided she was over it. She loved that moth once it emerged and was sad when we let him go. Kids are strange.

Scoliosis sure is a bitch.  i think ill call you with a date for spinal correction surgery instead Mom told me to stand up straight all through my teenage years, got a job, told a coworker i was decent friends with to stand up straight, she promptly responded, \"I have scoliosis you asshole!\" I've haven't told anyone to stand up straight since.  Proof you would bend over backwards for your friends. I was taking pictures with friends for our 11th grade prom, and my friends sister who was taking the photo said to me, Stand up straight! I had no idea at that time I had scoliosis. But now that I know, Im pretty sure she was talking about my uneven shoulders  Wow.. 11th grade prom and you had no idea? Is it common for people not to know that late into life that they have scoliosis? No pain or anything that wasn't eye opening?  Now I feel creepy and want to see a normal pic of you  I DEFINITELY had pain. I started experiencing pain in ninth grade, but I thought it was due to an injury. I played softball and I was sliding into home base and somehow messed up and landed weirdly on my tailbone/lower spine so I figured the pain was from that. The beginning of my senior year, I was getting changed for PE class, and I was wearing a hoodie. I noticed that the sleeve on my left arm was shorter so I showed my PE teacher just because (we were friends, it was a small town). She mentioned possibly that I could have scoliosis. I went home that day, brought it up to my mom and she didnt believe it. I went about 5 months until I decided to confirm if I had it or not, by going to the doctor to check on a broken toe I had, and I asked her for an x ray on my spine. I got one that day, and thats where this x ray came from. I suspected I had scoliosis, but my mom really didnt believe it until the x ray came up. Typically, scoliosis is caught when youre younger. But at my physicals Id have growing up, every time the doctor would ask me to touch my toes, he didnt see any sign of scoliosis. Now, if I were to touch my toes, you would see a rib hump. Im now a junior in college, so Ive had this pain for about 6 years now with no relief.

Some people think it's a myth. But if you're curious, don't wait. Take a trip. Find it. It's out there somewhere in the woods. Waiting... Wow you really must have hated your job!Great work I already stole it and made it my wallpaper Thank you! I'm a photographer, which to be fair is better than many other jobs I could have chosen, but I ended up with a lot of not so great clients who either don't pay me on time, or aren't willing to pay me enough for what they demand of me. On top of that, I'm tired of having to drive an average of 1.5hrs-4hrs every time I have a job to do, and I'm tired of carrying multiple pounds of gear and being on my feet for sometimes 8 hours straight without being able to take a break. The particular industry I'm in can also be very pretentious and a kind of self centered. All of that has slowly been chipping away at my enjoyment of it, and I'm now at the point where I dread every single job I have, and instead dream of being home with a brush in my hand.My heart's just not in it anymore, but painting is something I have been drawn to my whole life, and my experience so far (I've been at it for about 2 years) has been a million times more enjoyable than photography ever was. I've met great people, everyone is supportive of everyone else's work, and it's a much more welcoming community in general.I know that turning a passion/hobby into a job is an easy way to end up hating it, but having done that with photography I know what kind of mistakes to avoid in order to keep that from happening with art/painting. Wow thanks for sharing! It's unfortunate that things had to turn out that way, but at the same time may have been an important step in guiding you on your true path. Good luck in the future my friend, whether you rekindle your passion and enjoyment for photography or take a bold step towards painting I hope all goes well, you seem to be a very talented individual!"}, {"id": "f4i8w3", "caption": "This seaman rag growing mushrooms", "image_hash": "9jafvybkg6h41.png", "text": " That motherfucker needs to find a doctor or a gardener stat ...

This actually has a reason for \"figure-8\"ing power cables to prevent induction that may be dangerous loads due to adding an induction coil (by wrapping said cable in a coiled fashion).It looks like they are in the middle of an install, and did their best between shifts, (at least I hope).Cool pic though! Thanks! Shower thought & ELI5, does it create magnetic field? An added bonus, is that figure 8-ing prevents the cable from bird nesting while running the cable. The common circular coil like the one at the base of the pole tends to tangle on itself as you pull the cable out. Yes, but that's not why they did it. It prevents possibly dangerous electrical spikes on the line from being as dangerous by limiting the electrical power that can come through it Well, you're not wrong, if it wasn't an 'over/under' coil. Also, never really heard of a bird's nest (for cable mess), typically rat's nest. Anyway, updooting. Looks to me like they left enough cables to prepare a new underground line. The conduit running along the pole looks empty, so it's likely these cables are there for preparation. Many companies will run cable in-house and have other contractors complete the burial work.I've been out of the game for a while, though. I could be wrong. I highly doubt it's there to limit current, though.

This is my wood stove, and while it heats the studio and shop area it needs constant attention to keep it lit. I  sometimes throw in a few pieces of charcoal to maintain a bed of hot coals. The wood has to be cut pretty small which takes extra time, but all in all it heats using scrap wood no one else wants. If you haven't already, take a look at this fellows site.

As someone who works in agriculture I can guarantee you that weed killers do not harm bees, however if insecticides are mishandled they can (raid for instance).  For the average persons yard you dont need to use chemical to kill them. Just get out there and pull them up before they seed out. Do that for a couple years and your yard wont have them. They even make a little tool to get the root out. Personally I dont care about removing them but if they seed our your neighbor may not like it. Plus then they will end up spraying them leading to more chemical use... This is bullshit. The most common dandelion herbicide is 2,4-D which is short for 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic Acid. This is what you find in most granule weed'n'feed type products as well as liquid spot treatments. ***It is not toxic to bees.***Most people are not using Glyphosate(which is toxic to bees), found in Roundup-type herbicides, on dandelions since it also kills all the grass around the weed.  You don't really give a shit about this, do you gallowboob... All bees die with their tongues sticking out.

Helping butterflies requires that you have both host plants and nectar plants.  You don't need to buy butterflies or doing anything super complicated to support them.  Just a handful of well chosen plants will support butterflies in your area.  Also- DON'T USE WEEDKILLER.  Weedkiller starves butterflies.[Baltimore Checkerspot is considered an endangered butterfly](  Baltimore Chckerspots are native [from parts of Canada south to Virginia and North Carolina. They can be found in much of the Eastern United States west to the Great Lakes region](  The most vital plant for Baltimore Checkerspots is its host plant [white turtlehead](  White Turtlehead is not super pretty, but it is an important plant.  It needs moist ground and a decent amount of sun everyday, so it can't be grown everywhere.  If you are in the right part of the country, with a naturally moist sunny area, planting White Turtlehead can do some real good.  For nectar, Baltimore Checkerspots enjoy Milkweed (which also hosts Monarch Butterflies).  [Rose Milkweed]( also likes wetter ground and full sun, so they can make a good Butterfly supporting pair in some eastern US yards.  (People often have a section of wetter ground near where their gutters let out).[Frosted Lupin and Kerner Blue]( are two more endangered butterflies native to the Northeastern and Midwestern US.  [Wild Lupine]( is a host plant for both species, but is spreads easily and is not well suited to small yards.  Wild Lupine needs full sun, but will adapt to a range of medium to dry soils.In the SF Bay, the [Callippe Silverspot Butterfly is endangered](  It has only one host plant [California Yellow Pansy]( I finally seen my first butterfly this year yesterday.

I'm currently just starting the process of being screened to become a living donor. I had a daughter who passed away of SIDS many years ago. It was too late for me to have any of her organs donated.. so I want to do this in her memory. I really hope I'm able to help someone in this way, too! I'm from the UK, and my mother had renal failure and was on dialysis for 6-8 hours a day, 3 times a week for almost 10 years.She finally received a kidney transplant , unfortunately from a cadaver. The rules in the UK at that time (This was 20 years ago, I don't know if they've changed since) meant that she wasn't allowed to know the identity of the donar, or meet their family. It always played on her mind that she wasn't able to fully express her gratitude and how that person's action of registering on the UK donar registry had given her life back. She ultimately was allowed to write a letter which the hospital passed on, but it's not quite the same.Please *never* underestimate what a difference you've made to someone's life. And not just their life, the lives of their family and loved ones. The world would benefit greatly from more people like you.I wish you both health and happiness! Recipient: wonder how long i have to be her friend now Picture of 2 people You're an amazing person for donating your spare! My mom donated her kidney to me and it's been 4.5 years now.

Now's our chance to incorporate some wood paneling and put in a nice carpet. This picture illustrates the construction reasonably well.  The ventilated, fairly light walls are joined at the top by vaults of relatively thin masonry, which push out.  Where required, buttresses on the outside prevent the walls from swaying outwards from the force of the vaults.  The whole structure is essentially extremely wide.  All this is stone, which doesn't burn.  The mortar between stones is vulnerable.  I don't know how important mortar is in this gothic stone building work.  The roof, which is mostly what burned, simply sits on top to shed water.  Its remains will be on top of the vaulted ceiling.I imagine some consideration will be made for maintaining structural integrity, and some interim roofing will be installed.  Of course, in my neck of the woods, every WalMart within 300 miles would be stripped of its blue tarps!  Wouldn't be surprised if strong, reinforcing scaffolding or other structure was constructed to fill the interior, both strengthening the structure and providing secure access to all parts of the interior stonework.  Similar bracing and access might be useful on the outside.  Was time to check and redo everything anyway.Restoring the wood and other perishable interior work will be rather demanding.  And rebuilding the roof - that will be a battle.  Reasonable people can differ on whether to go with traditional (but flammable) wood or to go with light metal.

Haha Paint me like one of your French crash test dummies, jack! Those slippers look pretty warm... I mean, youll get behind it. Just keep on trying. Faces are also a problem of mine What are you talking about, those faces are beautiful!! Keep the faces like this. Its fantastic  I think there's something charming about those faces on those bodies. How are you learning? Like are you taking a course? This is really cool! Your proportions are looking great!One thing that helped me learn faces was to 'unlearn' them as faces- we get hung up on what we think faces should look like, maybe even copying other artists, and that makes it tough to get it right.Try turning a picture of a face upside down, or even solarize them in photoshop- stop focusing on drawing 'eyes' and 'nose' and such- try to draw the *shapes* that you see instead. It's not easy to make your brain do this, but it is super fun! And it does really help. Good luck and I hope you continue! You got the hard part down - proportions! For the face work, pull some portraits from the interwebz and focus on drawing those. Then when you feel comfortable with it, combine them with the bodies."}, {"id": "dc7g4o", "caption": "Just a picture of my sectoral heterochromia  !", "image_hash": "lcnvelb0b3q31.jpg", "text": " Nice Love it!!

I placed half the mix in a heavily buttered pan. The pan was too big, but it was what I had.The pretty top layer called for a lot of veggies that I wasn't going to waste, so I minced a bit of radishes, mushrooms, basil, sweet peppers, red onion, garlic, parsley, and chives up, and sauteed them in butter. I added the veggie mix on top of the dough and sprinkled some spicy adobo seasoning on there. I also added some roasted garlic cloves I had made earlier in the day. Then I covered it all up with 6 slices of havarti cheese I had leftover from sandwich supplies. I spread the rest of the dough in top and baked it for about 15 mins on 450F or whatever the Bisquick box said. Drunk, remember?Anyway, after the top started to brown, I pulled it out (giggity) and brushed the whole top with butter, and added all the pretty veggies on the top. I sprayed them with some olive oil pam and put the beast back in the oven for about ten more mins.I couldn't really wait for the whole thing to cool to try it and I'm glad I didn't; it's cheese is gooey and the bread is warm and buttery from brushing the top and buttering the pan. 11\\10 would recommend; experiment with baking guys, it's worth it!!! Nice, I imagine cornbread would taste amazing like that. That is bad ass! That is cool as hell. Well that's fucking adorable Wow - that bread has a great Joan Miro vibe. Nice work.

Decomposition and regrouping for place values in math... This reminds me of that riddle: you have two coins that total 35. What coins do you have if one ISN'T a quarter? As a math textbook editor, I can tell you its super misleading to show this one problem out of context. These students have undoubtedly been taught something like this: 8 + 5 = 8 + 2 + 3 = 10 + 3 = 13. That type of decomposition is a very standard arithmetic strategy. (Ive been using it since way before Common Core was a thing,) The teachers response should be understood in the context of the work the class has been doing.Could students figure out 8 + 5 without that strategy? Sure. But they learn the strategy now so they can use it in much more advanced math problems later.In general, please dont leap to conclusions about something without considering what the context may be. 10 = 8+5-3 What the shit. That is how I work the problem, and that is one badly-worded un-question. I'm almost thirty and this is how my mom taught me to do arithmetic. It's faster. 8 is 2 away from 10, so take 2 from 5, then you have 10+3 which is much easier. It's literally how I think now.

And they are not strewn about on the floor so that I walk all over it.Things I tend to hoard are containers and building materials because I like to build stuff, but not have to buy the stuff. Building materials can be things like string, chain, wood/plastic  panels, dowel rods, hooks, shower curtain rings (only the metal kind). Prettymuch anything I consider potentially useful. I see people throwing away perfectly good things and it drives me nuts!  I also organize it. I don't strew it about everywhere.  SOmetimes I go through stuff and throw stuff away if I think I have more than I could ever use or just have too much of it.I like to make use of things. Example... I saw a small wire metro shelving shelf on the side of the road. It was in fantastic shape and I thought I could use it in one of my metro wire shelving units (I have several), but it was the wrong shape. So I held onto it. When I bought a portable washer (about half the size of a normal washing machine) I needed something to put it on since it needs to gravity-drain the water. So I took one of the aluminum tent poles (from an old large pavilion tent) cut it into pieces with a pipe cutter, put some rubber furniture footies (I hoarded months earlier) on the bottoms, scored holding lines on the tops so the plastic metro shelf holders (I have a bunch) could grip the poles. Now I have perfectly useful stand for my portable washer. And it didnt cost me a penny! I also like to hoard money by being frugal.

My dogs don't really care about the squirrels but they keep them off the house due to them just being there, I really enjoy watching them run in the trees and play around.Oh lol I had a neighbor shoot one of our windows out trying to kill the squirrels, they had filled his truck with walnuts and when he was going on a boating trip his truck burned down due to the walnuts. My wild squirrel buddy begs for peanuts too! He'll literally wait for me to come outside and if I'm taking too long he'll climb the fence to get up to the window and stare at me through it until I feed him some :)  My co-worker was telling me about his mom's squirrel that climbs up on the wreath on her door and has learned to use the knocker to call her! Crazy tree rats! LOL \"I don't have peanuts, but I do know I've got some peenuts in my pocket.\" They've been called Rats with furry tails before. This one was fearless. Would come in the house if I held the door for him.  He also took peanuts from my hand. If I came outside to feed them he would grab a peanut and stand between my feet to eat it where the other squirrels were afraid.  Its probably why I didnt care about the screen.I can see where a burned truck would change a personal opinion rather quickly, especially missing a fishing trip. I also keep fresh water in an old dog bowl out on the porch.  They are used to coming on the porch.  Pull up in my truck, they want fed.  Open the door, same.  I had one curious squirrel tamed to feed from my hand.  They are good \"pets\" you don't have to worry about feeding when you go away.  (Or pick up \"afterwards\") I was buying peanuts at a feed store in large bags.  I had 9 squirrels in my yard at the same time, all about 3 feet apart eating peacefully last fall.

I mean what is the point in leaving a bag of crap tied neatly on the side of a trail? Is there a magic fairy that comes around and picks them up? If you want to hike with a dog it is your responsibility that their poop is disposed of. No one likes carrying a bag of dog shit, you're not special in that respect. If I'm on a long hike I'll bring a large Ziploc bag and pick up my dogs poop, double bag it and put it in the Ziploc and then put it in either the pack my dog is carrying or in a stuff sac tied to the outside of my backpack. If we are on a multi day trip, I'll bury that shit like you would with human waste. Just don't be a dick and leave your dog shit for someone else to deal with.*Edit-I can't spell Dog owner, here.  I agree with this 100% Why dont they install a trash can or something? Who wants to carry dog shit home? I like the idea of making the dog carry the poop.  I mean, I feel ya. No one wants to carry shit home but sounds like this is their personal property, a farm, and is therefore not their responsibility to provide a trash can. It's the law and common decency to dispose of your dog's shit yourself. Somebody being an asshole dog owner who isn't taking responsibility for their own shit doesn't mean a private residence owner should take personal and financial responsibility to dispose of your shit. If you think that's a thing great, I have other bags of trash I can drop off at your place so you can pay to have them hauled off. It's the same thing.  Your dog, you carry it out. Personal responsibility and all ya know. It's like you didn't read the sign at all. I also just tie the poop bags to my dogs harness.

This only makes sense if you don't think about it at all.The Government regulates the heck out of a lot of those things, especially TV and Radio.  Try starting your own broadcast TV station sometime, or talk to all the people who have been prosecuted for operating an unlicensed radio station.  The 1st Amendment applies to speech, the government can't restrict the speech, but they can sure as heck restrict you from spreading it however you want.  Even the internet has restrictions on the kinds of content that is legal to host.  You can't just post anything you want, and be immune from consequence.As for the 4th Amendment, I think it's pretty clear that the NSA and FBI can access and record all the metadata that our phones transmit, which includes things like our location, the times we were on the phone, the times we were using the phone's data services, and a boatload of other things that I think most people would consider \"unreasonable\" for the government to just know without having a warrant.  Used to be if the government wanted to tail you, they had to specifically task people with that job.  Now they just call up AT&T.  So the 4th Amendment doesn't really seem to apply to Electronic Wiretapping very much at all, ditto on the Video Surveillance, if you aren't in your own house, you are fair game to be recorded by anyone for any reason or no reason.As for the 2nd, I suppose that's right, it of course doesn't refer only to 18th century firearms.  But equally farcical is that idea that the government can't restrict which ones you can own.  If the 4th doesn't prevent them from tracking me, and the 1st doesn't allow me to start a radio station, then the 2nd doesn't necessarily allow you to own whatever guns you want without any interference from the authorities in terms of licensing and training requirements and simply restrictions on weapon systems that have no purpose outside of warfare. Exactly; we should be able to bear modern arms.  Well, free speech has plenty of regulations on it (eg: FCC obscenity rules, or that the US is nowhere near the top of the Press Freedom Index), so that's a good point - just like speech, arms should be regulated. 18th century firearms aren't even legally considered firearms anymore. 1. FCC exists. We updated our regulations to cover the new technology. He has a point  My view is, at that time the citizens and military had the same technology.  Yet now, they want to impose a power differential where there's no chance that that a  militia consisting of citizens could actually  oppose a military force of any kind.  The 2nd let the citizens have the same tech, we should have that today. Sure, but that doesn't mean there can't be regulation. Most rights have some form of limit, as the Supreme Court recognises...> Like most rights, the Second Amendment right is not unlimited. It is not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose:  For example, concealed weapons prohibitions have been upheld under the Amendment or state analogues. The Courts opinion should not be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.  that whole argument is dumb, there were fully automatic weapons in the 18th century... im sure the founding fathers understood weapons tech was likely to improve also..

She actually writes the month/year it was purchased on the top. (No idea why she does this, but she also writes dates on pillows because those go bad after a certain amount of time.) I donate food getting closer to the expiration date to our food pantry so it will get used before it expires. Now stuff in the refrigerator/freezer are another issue.  Most of it was from when my mother was a vegan, AKA perishables and opened items. Some items expired in 2010. Most things were out of date by around 2-3 years, so I wouldn't touch them.

Theyre the same species. From the [Wikipedia](The distinction between \"doves\" and \"pigeons\" is not consistent. In everyday speech, \"dove\" frequently indicates a pigeon that is white or nearly white; some people use the terms \"dove\" and \"pigeon\" interchangeably. In contrast, in scientific and ornithological practice, \"dove\" tends to be used for smaller species and \"pigeon\" for larger ones, but this is in no way consistently applied. Historically, the common names for these birds involve a great deal of variation between the terms. The species most commonly referred to as \"pigeon\" is the species known by scientists as the rock dove, one subspecies of which, the domestic pigeon, is common in many cities as the feral pigeon.Great picture!

Fuck yea! If you have a manual 35mm camera, there's a small button on the underside that will allow you to reset the shutter without advancing the film spool. You hold that down while you pull the reset lever, and then take another exposure on the same frame. You have to either underexpose both shots, or at least make sure that overexposing the frame won't wash out your image entirely.

It was from an article written about proto-Fascist regimes, meaning regimes that imitated Fascist imagery but rejected Fascist ideology. In the early 2000's, an anti-Bush Libertarian rewrote the Britt article into a vague list and claimed these were defining characteristics of Fascism. He also claimed Britt was a political scientist and doctor. He was neither. Britt had been a corporate executive and then a novelist. The original article on proto-Fascism was used to promote his book.The Britt list was then propagated by Jeff Rense, a Holocaust denier and conspiracy theorist. At that time he was also friends with Alex Jones and helped him with his radio program. Eventually, Rense and Jones had a falling out. But they were responsible for propagating the Britt list and making it famous on the internet.Overall, the list had nothing to do with actual Fascism. It has no credibility. It's been recycled over and over. Conspiracy theorists used it to portray Bush, Obama and Trump as Fascists, but it never reflects reality. They forgot \"accusing anything I don't like as either fascism or communism.\" I know, it's scary how many times this has been reposted. Well if the poster said so Arent the current English nationalists the opposite of sexist because they want to protect 12 year old girls from getting drugged and gang raped by immigrants? picture of text -1 They missed disarming the masses. The only warning sign of fascism is trying to unite the thiefs and their victims under a plausible idea, e.g. virtues of the nation or a form of a government. Let's stop it here, I don't think it would make sense to go on.OP won't make a statement going  into any detail. Which point on the list wasn't met will be their secret.You don't seem to know what a rhetorical question is, you find asking for an elaboration annoying, and you have a problem with your manners, especially language.

Also is this how they make chicken nuggets? I was never sure how they make that pink slime stuff The purpose of culling the males?They dont produce eggs so not cost effective to keep themThe purpose of this post?Probably hoping to shock people to not eat eggsBest guess is the OP is probably vegan with no none vegan friends because they are tired of the preaching animal feed. No one needs roosters. To kill the males as they dont lay eggs Hens age and stop laying so new Hens are needed. There's no way to tell males from females in the egg. Once they hatch they're kept long enough to check the sex, then the males are discarded as shown and the females spend their life laying eggs. Given the conditions in some egg factories it might be better to go quick like this. (Other egg farms are more humane.) I think they do slaughter or sell them to a slaughterhouse but only after they are kept around for egg-laying for a certain time.

Stop making art because people have already made better art! \"Listen Man, early humans have been painting in caves since the BC's by dudes ingesting hallucinogenic plants in much more hazardous conditions\" r/suspiciouslyspecific r/gatekeeping This is so true, graffiti is stagnated as fuck.    There's no new wave, there's no new styles, the culture isn't dead but it hasn't gone forward at all.     I'd love to be proven wrong though.Edit: Guys I'm talking about graffiti, not street art."}, {"id": "fqk0jf", "caption": "I shot a Common House Gecko", "image_hash": "7tsjlx6zyep41.jpg", "text": " Was going to ask what caliber used, then saw the pic and realized I should go back to sleep.

We just had that dilemma, got a dumpster for spring cleaning, no choice but to throw away perfectly good crap.. The plaque build up of capitalism! Just because you don't want it, doesn't mean they do. There is a clearly posted sign that says donations are only accepted during business hours.

Im hesitant to buy one, but my 6+ is now officially too old. amazing! thank you! The phone is light years ahead of the 6+, BUT you cant go wrong if you got the iPhone X or XS. I bet you have to charge that phone 3 times a day by now, eh? Actually, depending on use, I have to charge it before the day is done, so I guess twice at most. With my first iPhone I was very diligent with charging at about 45% and it paid off. But not so much with this phone and the battery drains faster. The problem is wanting the most capacity on a new phone which will cost more. Im not in a great financial position right now, so Im going to have to hang onto my phone a bit longer.

Put a 4 (or more) bay hot-swap 212 inch cage into two of those 514 inch drive bays and populate it with some 1\\~2TB laptop drives.   2. Put a CD-ROM (or DVD-R/W, BlueRay, whatever) drive into the third bay.2. Install [FreeNAS]( with RAIDz.3. Rip every single one of those discs and store the music on your FreeNAS box.You now have all your music (and the games) available at any time over your home network. It's protected by RAIDz, so if a hard drive dies just replace the drive without losing any data. Keep the originals in storage somewhere as backup. Skeletons from the Closet.

Next thing you know she'll be making a coffee table book about coffee tables! yo dawg I heard you like grocery bags. Theres a lot of flack in the comments, but this can be a way to reuse the otherwise disposable bags. Where I live this type of bag is non-recyclable. The best thing is to not use plastic in the first place, but we all cant deny the majority of people have a stash of these bags in their laundry room or below their sink. At least weaving them together increases durability and the amount of use compared to reusing the original bag that will rip immediately. In my city there is a organization working with homeless women to teach them how to make plastic yarn (plarn), teaches them to crochet, and how to sell their products. The bags are given by donation or they pull them out of trash cans and clean them. For many of the women this is the first step toward boosting self-esteem in being able to learn a new skill and benefit from it. I was given a beautiful woven basket from this as a thank you for volunteering over two years ago and its still on display in my home. The ideal solution is to eliminate plastic bags, but theres still a plethora of them people own before the bag bans and as least this is a way to create something reusable from them.

Although I don't have the curb weights for these two cars, as a general trend passenger cars have increased in weight for each of the last few decades.  I would imagine the car in the background is heavier... although there are some exceptions out there.  PS - any M-B fans got the numbers? Really? I thought cars have gotten lighter because of lighter materials which help with fuel efficiency.  Well thats a 1970s 300SEL weighing in at 4,010lbs. And the CLA250 peeking around her is 3,274Lbs.    But you should see the inside .... stunning Theres data to show that cars have gotten heavier, much due to increased safety equipment, infotainment, and overall size.  However, as pointed out in this case Im wrong.  However, I think these are also cars from two different size classes.  More comparable modern Mercedes are going to be heavier still. Ah, thanks for the numbers.  I was wrong in this case.  Ill take the 300SEL! Just in this case tho, their are many cars that are vise-versa now, but HELL YEAH freakin thing was so smooth and the seats were like baby angels holding clouds which were designed for just your butt! I Melted into the car honestly  Considering the modern version is an S-Class which weighs like 5000lbs.  Anyway, 70s European cars are all that.  Ive had a couple of early 70s Volvos.  So quality. I wouldnt mind a new S or one better the CLS .... and my Sunday driver classic of course !"}, {"id": "a9wj2n", "caption": "The longer you look at him  , the bigger  , the nastier he gets  !", "image_hash": "uq3p0vbzfr621.jpg", "text": " You misspelled delicious  r/2healthbars I keep getting hungrier!

My dad was an alcoholic and the worst experience I had as a kid (I must have been 6 or 7?) was going home one evening and my dad struggling to open the door because he couldn't hit the keyhole with his key, stumbling and losing balance, hitting his head against the wall and passing out. I remember freaking out crying loudly and the neighbour lady rushing out into the hallway thinking he was dead. She got me inside her apartment and reached my mom somehow. So many weekend nights spent at my dad's, answering drunk, blabbering questions. He died homeless last year and I hadn't spoken to him in years, mainly because I'd gotten to the age where I could decide not to see him. Drunk calls where he cried and spoke incoherently. He was Greenlandic, too, so he sort of looks like the guy in this picture. He wasn't violent or malicious, thankfully. Still takes me horrible places :(  I don't know why I typed this out.. I guess don't have kids if you're an alcoholic and if you are, don't ever get stoopid drunk while you're watching over your kid  I wish I could do something now, but I've come to realise that kids aren't supposed to take of their parents. Stay safe out there I was only just telling my wife about how I would have to carry my father home from the pub on a regular/weeklybasis when I was a child this week. she asked why I don't talk about my Father/childhood much. It's odd that I login here and see this photo takes me straight back to those years. We need to make choosing not to drink more popular than choosing to drink. We need to make non drinkers as comfortable as we make drinkers instead of treating the non drinkers as party poopers or even excluding them.   Saddest.  Alaska for sure  Damnit Frank!

Haley Joel osmont can afford candy, we know it man. Just so I can stop replying (because I thought this was going to get 5 or 10 likes) and didn't think anyone would care. 1- EVERY kid and teen got candy. No one left empty handed. 2- Yes, those are full size Reese's I gave full size to kids (over 4-ish) that said \"trick or treat\" and fun size to everyone else. 3- Parents really appreciated it because they used it to try to get their kids to say \"trick or treat.\" Not one single adult the whole night complained and I live in a town of complainers. We do it VERY well. 4- This photo was taken before I set up and played Halloween and dance music for the neighborhood like I do every year. 5- The title and look were just for posting something funny. My partner thought I should post it on Reddit because it was doing well on my social media.  6- I know I'm fat, I've known that since I was about seven. Years ago my neighborhood used to unite on one driveway to give away candy. One of the father's got pissed that no one was saying \"trick or treat\" and decided the next kid wasn't going to get candy till he said it. Next group of kids were deaf and couldn't understand why they weren't getting candy till the mom noticed and yelled they are deaf! Yup.... My buddy is going to burn in hell Thats pretty damn funny!Well done I can only assume you also got into a few *very* atupid and immature arguments as well?I bet that was entertaining lol.

But also learn to cherish the things that you do have. On an upbeat note, world poverty rates have actually decreased 74.1% in the last 25 years.

This is what government corruption does to countries, families, children.Edit: ok, downvote it  Im writing this absolutely expecting to have 57 #MAGA morons coming at me out of the woodwork, but it needs said. Im amazed at how cold some people can be to awful human suffering. I believe its because a lot of people in the US have never gone truly without - without shelter, without a shower, without water, without being able relieve yourself with dignity. I only got a small taste of it when deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan, but it changed my perspective for life. A shower and a warm dry bed are amazing blessings. People usually respond to this with if you care so much you give them your home.  I do work with refugees, and can 100% vouch for it. Nothing you will buy for yourself this year will give you as much satisfaction as the gratitude of parents who now can hope their children will outlive them. Then there are the arguments that we dont know what were getting when we let refugees in. 100% bullshit. Refugees are exhaustively vetted. The army translators I work with spent years dodging people trying to saw their heads off before they finally got their visas. People spend years in refugee camps before their paperwork comes through. Tourists and students (like the 9/11 hijackers, for instance) get next to none. To my knowledge, there has only ever been one incident with a refugee in the last few decades and it was minor.  Its proven that refugees and immigrants commit fewer crimes than natural-born US citizens. Then people say we cant afford it. 1. Nonsense - you mean we choose not to afford it, and secondly, refugees and immigrants start businesses at a much higher rate than native born citizens. Check out sometime how much of the Fortune 500 companies were started by immigrants or their children. I know in advance Im going to catch some flak for saying this, but if you dont agree with me - seriously, you need to examine your soul. I was recently speaking to someone who said he didnt care if that little Mexican girl the same age as his daughter got raped by a gang in Honduras or died of thirst in the desert - she isnt an American. If thats your version of humanity, take the American flag off your profile, stop describing yourself as a Christian and stop singing home of the brave at your sacred NFL games. Im an atheist, and even I believe Jesus was right when he said For I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink, 43 I was a stranger and you did not invite me in, I needed clothes and you did not clothe me, I was sick and in prison and you did not look after me.44 They also will answer, Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or needing clothes or sick or in prison, and did not help you?45 He will reply, Truly I tell you, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me.Matthew 24:42-45I fervently hope when my children need mercy and kindness, the United States is offered more grace than we have shown as a nation in these past few years.

I went down to the plum tree and they were putting up some 2X4's.  I helped them prop the 2X4's up and then I saw what they had seen for years.  I asked my daughter, \"Do you want a funky treehouse or a cute treehouse?\"  She went with funky, and there you go.  And I pulled from as much childhood dreams as possible.  I did not have a tree in my house, so yeah, I probably built some of it for little me.   Yep.

I gotta say that I'm pretty shocked that my picture has been going viral this week  for the people who don't know the story: My servant woke up friday and a friend of her saw me on the front page of reddit and messaged her. She was pretty shocked too because she knew that my picture was on a few facebookgroups for cats etc., but she didn't know that my picture would be going viral like that! My servant commented that my name is Thor and that she was my servant, but nobody really believed her, so she made an Imgurpost about me to prove it  while going on Imgur, she saw another post about me, also on the front page of Imgur! Even more shocked  Then she got messages that Thor has been circulating all over the internet, and indeed, my servant found facebookposts, blogposts, even articles on playbuzz about me  and meanwhile, the Imgurpost my servant made about me, also went viral!

I'm not sure what you could add that would make me like it more. Good job Nice work but after checking out your other posts, WOW, you use the same phrases in your titles a lot. I say this from experience and with no intent of offense: Never let yourself depend on attention and the affirmation of others. Otherwise if that attention moves on, youll have a hell of a time getting your motivation in gear. Your art shouldnt matter to people because of your age ([X yo]) or because of your own humility (aspiring). It should matter because its art that youre willing to show the world.  And age wont matter once youve reached an age at which people would expect to see skill from practice. Basically, make sure you do this for *you* first and foremost. Not because you can get dependable, affirming reactions from people.

I want that Transplants shirt Yes it matters.  If you're in a state that allows mail-in or early voting.  Take advantage, if not, vote those who are against it out of office. Does what matter?  The same thing Ive been doing since 4 more years became a thing? Yeah, it matters.  Even if the position you take is or is not ultimately the prevailing party.  Oops!  Just found out it doesnt! I tried my preference, and failed. Let's just try to get the neon orange guy out. Nice tits Is that whoopi goldberg? If you have a dissenting opinion? Absolutely. If you just agree with the status quo? Not as much. The only way to change people using the apathy argument is to change the percentages enough that the argument falls apart. people can't say that they refuse to vote because their vote doesn't matter if their district becomes less red or blue over a few election cycles. Just look at Texas. The number of Democratic voters in that state has slowly risen over the last few decades, and now it's not a guaranteed electorate for a Republican candidate.States like California and New York have surprisingly large conservative polling results, But their voter turnout is not representative of that. The same can be said for the Bible belt. A lot of polling information shows much more progressive views than the voter turnout reports. It seems like the tipping point of people not voting because they believe their vote doesn't count has been growing closer and closer. Just look at the Bernie Sanders results in the primaries that have happened so far. He's had a much larger vocal fan base, but the numbers at the ballot haven't been near as large Very cool"}, {"id": "e1s9pa", "caption": "My granddaughter saw the face first  . lol", "image_hash": "vrtwpgfady041.jpg", "text": " El dog.... we meet again BAHAHAHA!

My dad advised me against it. They took an hour of pay every week (1/20th of my check) and when mgmt screwed me on a scheduling issue, they totally ignored me. Fuck those guys. Lesson learned. if I see a picket libe I will proudly March through and buy double of whatever I intended. I used to support unions until, in my own experience, I realized that they are useless. What's a stop and shop? Why are they all wearing Jean's and sports hats? They say that Stop & Shops parent company, Ahold Delhaize, hasnt justified the cuts, noting that the Dutch food retail giant reported $2 billion in profits last year, and recently voted to give shareholders $880 million in dividend payments later this month.Stop and Shop's my neighborhood store but I'll never cross a picket line. Seems like corporate is profiting just fine and doesn't need to make any cuts. Sorry. I work with unions. Theyre a bunch of lazy bastards that bitch and moan about doing their job, but if you think for a second that you can assign that work to someone willing to do the job, they file a grievance.Fuck todays unions. They had a purpose once, and it was a great thing that they did. That was 50+ years ago. Theyre just another business now. Hmmm, ya I am good  Looks like a bunch of lazy ass workers. Lol liberals. Don't get me wrong unions and some of their workers are not perfect but I have worked manual labor trades all my adult life and I can tell you that unions are about the only way to get paid a decent wage with great benefits. I have several friends who work in unions they have all benefits paid, have retirement paid, and still have at least $35 a hour on the check. None of their benefits come out of their 35 a hour. When I work(non union) trades I only see $25-27 a hour and all my benefits and retirement comes from that $25-27. My buddies work long hours like I do, anywhere from 8-12 hour shifts and they get compensated much better than I. Like I said unions are not perfect because I've seen the ugly side of them too but I would personally prefer to rely on a union to get me paid than a non union company to pay me a fare wage because in my experience they don't and see you as expendable. Unions are not perfect but in a world that is seeing increasing wage gaps between the rich and the working class they at least help close the gaps and make sure those rich companies pay a decent wage. Even non trade unions are worth supporting like teachers, firefighter, and even mail delivery (USPS). Without strong unions business like Amazon can continue to be worth billions while their workers get terrible working condition and terrible pay. Without unions think of how shitty the world would be compensated if we left it up to billionaire CEOs that only care about profits. Like I said they are not perfect but they at least help to get people paid a fair wage and have good working conditions.

Oh, that's *very* cool I would leave a space between the painting and the window frame and then add edge-lights around the painting behind the frame. The painting will look brighter than the frame (it is usually brighter outside) and you get a little bit of parallax without shadows from the frame. I love lighthouses!! I would PAY for this. It's beautiful!! Amazing and weirdly similar to what I have been looking at doing. I found an artist based in Lightning Ridge, NSW that paints windows and surreal scenes and I have been obsessed ever since.

Even if he wins the primary (which I'd rate as less than a snowball's chance on Mercury's daylight side), I suspect he's not going to get much support from his own party in the general election. Beyond that, the incumbent has a massive advantage over the opposition, which shifts the advantage to Trump.

Apply this, along with the other suggestions mentioned thus far, you should see some great results. There is a lot of color in the sky... You just need to do post production to pull it out.  This isn't perfect as I'm editing a compressed jpeg.  If possible shoot in RAW format and edit in Lightroom or similar app.EDIT: I used Snapsneed for this edited version of your photo. Nice but too dark.maby more iso or less speed Ok thanks for the advice! I dont have money though... Thanks man! Wow dude. That picture looks really fucking good. Thanks for the app suggestion!

What is peacock \"Peafowl is a common name for three species of birds in the genera *Pavo* and *Afropavo* of the *Phasianidae* family, the pheasants and their allies. Male peafowl are referred to as peacocks, and female peafowl as peahens, though peafowl of either sex are often referred to colloquially as \"peacocks.\" The two Asiatic species are the blue or Indian peafowl originally of the Indian subcontinent, and the green peafowl of Southeast Asia; the one African species is the Congo peafowl, native only to the Congo Basin. Male peafowl are known for their piercing calls and their extravagant plumage. The latter is especially prominent in the Asiatic species, which have an eye-spotted \"tail\" or \"train\" of covert feathers, which they display as part of a courtship ritual.\"Grabbed the Wikipedia snippet on peacocks since it describes them most succinctly.

There are so many calendars used to calculate the dates though! India is the most complex case for calculating holiday observances I've found so far (followed closely by nearby countries that have been strongly Indian influenced).* Gregorian (Solar Tropical Year based)* Hindu   * Vikram Samvat (Luni-solar)   * Shaka Samvat (Saka Era) (Luni-solar)   * Indian National Calendar (Solar Tropical Year based)   * Malayalam (Sidereal Solar)* Hebrew (Luni-solar)* Persian   * Modern Jalali (Solar Observation Based)   * Shahenshahi Zoroastrian (Leap-Year Agnostic Medieval Iranian-derived Calendar)* Hijri (Lunar Observation Based)* Chinese (Luni-solar)* Nanakshahi (Sikh) (Solar Tropical Year based)* Bengali (Luni-solar)* Non-calendar Stellar Observations (VSOP87B + Meeus Algorithms + Swiss Emphemeris Algorithms Required)Complicating factors for Holi are mostly related to accurate assessment of the Tithi (Sunrise-to-sunrise OR sunset-to-sunset day period) associated with Phalguna's (February / March lunar month) Purnima (full moon).

This is the kind of shower I want!Edit: To be completely honest, I was mainly interested in the floor and wall design. An open-ish room with one or two shower heads. The rain shower head is interesting,  but Im just tired of small bathtubs and annoying ass curtains. This is false advertising. Rain falls in drops, not streams. If I wanted streams to hit my face, I'd call R. Kelly. I had one of these before and it felt great. My only problem with it was the force of the stream wasn't very strong.If I could find a rain shower head that shot the water out as forceful as multiple cumshots during a bukkake orgy I would buy it for sure!  These look incredible but are a little awkward to use. You either have to have water completely on your head, be standing outside the water and be cold, or do a lot of twisting. Overhead straight down showers always look cool but I don't like using them. It's weird having to stand engulfed in water head to toe if you want to get wet, and if you step out there is no water on you which sucks. There is no half in half out like an angled shower These shower heads are the worst. When you're in the shower, your entire face is constantly covered in water. When you're not in the shower, you're 100% not in the shower.With a normal one you can stand and breathe comfortably with water on your chest/back.

After we sold our last house, the new owner pulled out the chimney (center of the house) both fireplaces and the charcoal grill that was built into the kitchen.

He was bought as a gift for the ranch hands daughter, the dog went on a sabbatical at the ranch, apparently fought off javalinas, lived on his own for 2 weeks, hung out with the deer, got bit by a rattlesnake after dueling with it, killed it, then returned home and got treated.  After his journey, he went for another week of a sabbatical, almost got attacked by coyotes, decided he had seen enough.  Now he just hangs out at camp, true form of an alpha haha.  His name is Cocoa.  And for clarification, this was all documented through game cameras set up throughout ranch.  Going to try and get the videos from my uncle so I could post them, truly impressive and hysterical. A rathlethnake bithe Super sweet but how did it save its owner? Jump in the way of the bite at the very last second? Or did it just get bitten by a snake and its owner was like \"oh my goodness he saved me!\" Fairly old story Poor pup!

Mayor Pete supports endless war in the Middle East that has led to hundreds of thousands of deaths, viciously fights homelessness in in South Bend not with social programs but by pushing the police to arrest them and harassing the homeless in their most common encampment spots.

Credit to the photographer, [Tambako the Jaguar]( who took this on May 11, 2008 in Corcelles, Canton of Berne, Switzerland.> Walking golden tiger > A nice shot of the male golden tiger walking in his enclosure.> Nikon D300> /7.1  400.0 mm 1/500  800Edit: [Here]( are a few more images that the photographer took of this tiger. Actually thats a latte tiger It's not rare per se. The colour is caused by a recessive gene and influenced by captive breeding and inbreeding. These tigers cannot survive in the wild. The world has less than 4,000 wild tigers left. There are 3 times more tigers in captivity than in the wild.  This means that at this rate the wild tigers will become extinct soon and they will only exist in zoos and captivity and become inbred and unable to survive without assistance. The golden tiger is a result of this process where tigers, and many other wild endangered animals are becoming these furry cute organisms that will hardly resemble what their ancestors once were. An extremely rare tiger, used for an extremely common repost.  Golden tigers are not \"rare,\" nor are they a separate species. Like white tigers, they're the result of severe, repeated inbreeding and do not exist in the wild. Both \"golden\" and white tigers are Bengal tigers (or commonly, hybrids of the Bengal and Siberian subspecies) which have been selectively inbred for a recessive, mutant gene which causes the coat color to appear lighter or white. Today, you really only see them at unaccredited private zoos, sanctuaries, and circuses. **No legitimate conservation program or zoo breeds golden or white tigers anymore because they have *negative* conservation value.** [All white tigers can be traced to a *single* individual]( who was mated to his own daughter and granddaughter, and [all \"golden\" tigers can be traced back to *one* white tiger]( called Bhim, who was bred to his own sister and daughter. Their genetics are such a dumpster fire that they're *detrimental* to the health of the captive tiger gene pool, and [they often suffer from painful, chronic health problems and deformities due to the constant inbreeding required to produce them.]( It's almost unheard of to see a white or golden tiger *without* a cleft palate, organ deformities, malformed skull, crossed eyes, etc. and since the breeders are trying to produce a pretty tiger that the public will pay to see, cubs with too many visible deformities or which were born the \"wrong color\" are referred to by the industry as \"throwaway tigers\" and are typically killed. **It's rumored that in order to produce a *single* \"display quality\" white/golden tiger, anywhere from 40-60 other cubs are destroyed.** In 2011, the AZA, which accredits most legitimate zoos in the US, officially banned the breeding of white and golden tigers by their member zoos because it *\"created a confusing educational message, caused rapid depletion of the normal genetic variation and subjected some animals to poor welfare and health.\"* The only white or golden tigers you'll see in legitimate zoos now are either rescues, or older animals bred before the full implications of breeding them were understood.

She loved me more than the wife and kids!!! Just this side of heaven is a place called Rainbow Bridge.            When an animal dies that has been especially close to someone here, that pet goes to Rainbow Bridge. There are meadows and hills for all of our special friends so they can run and play together. There is plenty of food, water and sunshine, and our friends are warm and comfortable.           All the animals who had been ill and old are restored to health and vigor. Those who were hurt or maimed are made whole and strong again, just as we remember them in our dreams of days and times gone by. The animals are happy and content, except for one small thing; they each miss someone very special to them, who had to be left behind.           They all run and play together, but the day comes when one suddenly stops and looks into the distance. His bright eyes are intent. His eager body quivers. Suddenly he begins to run from the group, flying over the green grass, his legs carrying him faster and faster.            You have been spotted, and when you and your special friend finally meet, you cling together in joyous reunion, never to be parted again. The happy kisses rain upon your face; your hands             again caress the beloved head, and you look once more into the trusting eyes of your pet, so long gone from your life but never absent from your heart.           Then you cross Rainbow Bridge together.... Just sending love. So sorry for your loss. It's so hard to lose a loved pet and companion. Sorry for your loss, hope hes enjoying his time in a better place :) Dog lover here, didn't even know him and I miss him. More trustworthy than alot of humans. Im so sorry for your loss! Truly.

It depends on how deep the burn is. Electricity is an odd beast. Internal burns are dangerous because there aren't lots of nerve endings inside your body but if the finger doesn't swell or get unreasonably painful you should be okay. The exit point is generally where the larger damage takes place because it's the end of the circuit so it generates more heat.

I believe there are a bunch more secret service snipers hanging out on roofs, and other areas. Clinton came to an official visit to Thailand, where I lived at the time. I got to attend the reception at the American ambassadors residence in my high school bad (we played the music before and after his speech). There were people on every building rooftop, a large van with guys with what looked like enough firepower to stop anything, the guys in suits with ear pieces, and some stationed military.  After the speech he invited the band to meet him at the actual house, behind all the barriers put up. Took a picture with the entire band, then took the time to meet each member. Shook each persons hand. I was shocked that he was wearing a suit coat, and wasnt melting. Anyhow, was a cool experience. I'm more amazed someone allowed this picture to be taken. Got oneMayo on a hot dog?AffirmativeTake the shot Would they really take a shot at that distance in a crowd that dense? A lot of people are saying, \"I'm surprised they allowed this picture to be taken.\" It's a type of deterrence called a \"Show of Force.\" You don't want to shoot into a crowd of people, regardless of how good at shooting you are,  so you instead show the bad guys you have security people in place that *can* shoot and they *will* prevent the bad guy from accomplishing his mission. In other words, you make sure the bad guy knows he will be stopped before he can do his bad thing. It's not a bad thing to let the bad guys know, \"We're watching, we have the ability and the means, don't even bother trying. You'll just fail and waste your time.\" Damn, its sad something like this is necessary. Everyone seems to be missing the point that DONALD TRUMP WAS AT THIS GAME. It is not typical to see dozens of snipers perched all around stadiums at every sporting event as others are suggesting. I've shot before a few times, but I'm by no means a gun guy. From the safety lectures, you don't point a gun, loaded or not, at anything you don't want to kill. Are these professionals not in violation of that rule? As professionals with high grade equipment, do they not have to worry about certain general safety rules?Imagine being the guy unknowingly sitting with a 308 pointed at your skull from across the stadium all game. Those snipers are police.  I would have expected Secret Service or military."}, {"id": "g9z6v0", "caption": "Small baby turtle held by my not so small baby  !", "image_hash": "bcpjttyainv41.jpg", "text": " We found two baby hatchling painted turtles in our backyard pond.

Flying back from a cycling trip in South America, I opened my bike box to find my front wheel crushed.  I haven't had the rest of the bike checked out completely, but the case appears intact - no obvious damage from the outside.&#x200B;I noted that the straps were loosened when I retrieved it from the baggage carousel, but I assumed the security folks didn't take the same precaution to ensure things were buckled down. Were there any kind of scratches dents or impact evidence on the outside of the case in line with the wheel damage? If not then I would ask if the loose strap was on the side of that one wheel. I'm wondering if the wheel physically fell / slid out of the case, got caught on something, and was hastily put back in. Someone opened it up, bent the wheel over their knee, put it back in the case. Probably retaliation for them going though your shit only to find nothing they wanted to steal. It was most likely crushed my other luggage during the flight. They cut it open to look for drugs.  [ Thats my suspicion. My mechanic thinks theres no way this kind of damage would have been possible with external forces applied to the case, without the case itself being crushed (which it wasnt).  This is the only possible answer that makes sense, no damage on the outside of the case and its just one wheel.

When he and other firefighters entered the building, Lindler saw Jake cowering in a corner, having just crawled out from under a fallen piece of burning ceiling.> \"He was pretty scared and he wasn't moving a whole lot,\" Lindler told BuzzFeed News. \"We think he was in the corner of the building for about 10 minutes before I got to him.\"> Jake performed mouth-to-snout resuscitation on the pup, who was taken to the vet with second- and third-degree burns to over 75% of his body, including his paws. \"Most animals don't typically live with burns that severe,\" Lindler said.> When his neighbors said they weren't able to afford the puppy's vet costs, Lindler spoke with his wife about adopting Jake.The puppy had to stay under 24-hour medical care for six weeks, but he was eventually able to come home. \"My family just took to him like it was meant to be,\" Lindler said.> As Jake gradually recovered from his burns, he soon became a beloved fixture down at Linder's work, the Hanahan Fire Department.> \"I would just bring him here for shifts,\" Lindler said, \"and then the chief had the idea of making him a firefighter.\"> In December, Jake was sworn in as a city firefighter and also became the official Hanahan Fire Department mascot.> He now tours schools with Lindler to educate kids about the importance of fire safety.> He's also in training to become an arson-detecting dog, to help firefighters sniff out accelerants and flammable liquids at a burned-out site once the blaze is extinguished.> \"I was in the right place at the right time,\" Lindler said of rescuing his new best friend. \"I was there for him.

She was attacked with acid from her ex-boyfriend. What else do you need to know?? If she deserved it or something? I'm not understanding. He was probably really mad that she broke up with him.

If you havent tried oat milk yet, you should! Many find it to be the closest in consistency and its the best one for the environment. Its almond juice isnt it? Google says it's 23 gallons per cup instead of 30 with regular milk Arent you guys slightly suspicious about this?People have been giving cats milk for pretty much as long as they have been domesticated. The world population of cats has, I assume, grown steadily for thousands and thousands of years. Suddenly, milk is bad for cats. But dont worry, conveniently, Hills manufacturers a milk supplement/replacement for cats... Thanks! That sounds really good Ill give it a try I dont know too much about their products but I do believe the milk replacement is for kittens not full grown cats Cats are born with the enzyme lactase to digest lactose, and it passes from their gut flora as they are weaned. So yes, kittens can have milk, but in general, it's a safer rule of thumb to not give a cat milk.\"We've been doing it for [x] years!\" is a feckless defense of *any* act.

I tell my daughters to steer clear of these man childs.My rational is the child believes living on ones own would be too rough of a life.  So they stay under mommy and daddy's protection like a minor child does.Now I realize this is becoming more and more the norm sadly but doesn't change what it is.  An excusable live in condition would be one year of free rent and bill living to save up for a home but only a year. If one's living situation was an indicator of maturity level this country would not be in the position it's in right now.

Also, sorry for the potato quality It's strange because the clouds that pass by don't seem to go across the moon or inside the ring.  >What causes a ring around the Moon?  >  >Rings around the Moon are caused when moonlight passes through thin  clouds of ice crystals high in Earth's atmosphere. As moonlight passes  through the ice crystals, it is bent in a way similar to light passing  through a lens. The shape of the ice crystals causes the moonlight to be  focused into a ring. This is similar to the way water droplets in the  lower atmosphere can bend sunlight to create a rainbow.[&#x200B;Superstitions are that within the next 7 days, storms/snow is expected to fall. This phenomenon is explained to be from fronts moving in and arranging ice molecules in the air, thus creating a ring/rainbow circle, ahead of a storm front. Like a sun dog....It'z a moon cat.

This is why I dont have a penis... cause I would want to stick it in there. It works better as a medicinal rub for cuts and burns, or for use as a hair thingy (my wife uses it and apparently many people with thick hair do, thats the end of my knowledge there). I would not recommend it for eating. Some second hand experience here, when he was a child my older brother put his hands on a hot burner and burned them quite badly. My mother applied Aloe Vera gell on the hand that was worst burned of the two, and as they healed that hand actually ended up with less scaring than the one that was not as badly burned.

I have no coin knowledge and will do some research, but even it theyre just worth face value its a great score.***UPDATE***After looking through a few sources, it appears these are nothing special.  Only one has the S mint mark, and it is not silver. Looks for other variations/rarities, but nothing spotted. I may still take it to someone to take a look. eBay has tons of these for sale from $1.50-$2 a piece, but that would take patience.  Still a great find, and story. You must have been all excited to get some danish butter cookies but then *sad trombone* coins Sorry about that - I accidentally left it there when I moved out. Please let me know when I can come pick it up. Id hate to report you to the authorities. When I was young, rich men would ride about in zeppelins and drop coins on people. After I saw J. D. Rockefeller fly by, I ran out of my house with a big washtub to collect these coins. Thats at least $10. Looks like about 350$ When ever someone posts a discovery like this I will always give the same advice......keep looking! If they left one pile of coins - they likely left others. from what i can see those are 1971-1976 Eisenhower silver dollars for anyone wondering. they are worth just face value ~~as collector but have a value of \\~$5.50  in silver as they are 40% silver.~~E: I was mistaken. No silver, just face value. Sorry to get hopes up OP. Look at the coin edges. If you see a copper stripe running parallel to the coin, it's NOT silver. If you don't see that line, the coin is silver and worth considerably more.Source: I worked at a bank and we all skimmed these coins whenever they came through, putting a dollar in our till whenever we took one out. It was confirmed many times that this is definitive way to identify these silver coins. Very good OP, I see youve found my first clue.

NOTE: Romeo has no specific age in the play, so this is all conjecture.Except that part about Juliet, because she's totes 13 according to her dad. Romeo and Juliet has this weird reputation as this archetypal great love story and the tragedy is that they 'die for love' or whatever, when really the tragedy is that the lives of these two teenagers in the throes of their first romance/mutual infatuation get crushed because of the bitter, meaningless hatred between their families. It's really less about love than it is about how generational hatred destroys the lives of all involved in it. Six deaths: Mercutio, Tybalt, Paris, Romeo, Juliet. Who am I missing? Isn't it ironic that the board is signed \"everyone who actually read it\" and it incorrectly claims Romeo was 17 (considering his age is never established in the play)? I dislike this simply because its so snarky and presumptuous. Nice lettering though.  I see they have reddit there Check out the edgelord working at Barnes and Noble I can't tell which part is snarkier: the presumption of the statement, the \"everyone who actually read it\" crap or the overly-elaborate penmanship.In any case, this person is overcompensating for a very low-level joke.

I remember \"Morning Glory\" and most of those songs off that album getting big time play on Chicago's Q101.This album?  I mean, I remember the video for \"D'You Know What I Mean\" ever so slightly.  But I never really even remembered the song getting much airplay and I was never really interested in the album at the time.Perhaps this is a good time to check it out and take you up on your recommendation!  Maybe I've slept on this album all this time?Thanks for the share! Ah Paul Weller. Saw The Jam in 1982 at Bingley Hall Staffordshire. Bitterest Pill tour. It was good. It pissed me off when he broke the band up but hey we all have to move on. If you only know Oasis from Wonderwall, they did so much more than that. That song came off their second record, (Whats the Story) Morning Glory? Which  is one of the bestselling albums of all time. Expectations were high, and their next album, Be Here Now, is considered the most anticipated album in British history. Though it was hailed as a masterpiece upon release, the death of Princess Diana and political BS deemed the Cool Brittania period, well, uncool  and Oasis were the poster children for being cool.Some people say the album ruined Oasis (completely false). I say it was their peak. Im really passionate about this band and I seriously hope someone unfamiliar to them gets to enjoy it. Let me know what you think of it! I believe that Noel described this album as being written / recorded coked up.  Hey!Thanks for letting me know! The thing is, its different than anything Oasis has released up until 1997. I want to write a whole essay in this comment, but Im not going to lol. Ill let you be the judge.Listen to it and let me know what you think when you can! I think youll have a unique experience if you go back and listen to the first two albums after hearing this one here in 2020. Thanks again for the reply. Enjoy! Ive read several books, interviews and more that basically debunk that. Hes embarrassed that it wasnt the greatest album of all time and says shit like that in the press. Its completely untrue. Ill edit this comment with links so Im not talking out of my ass.Edit: Edit 2: Edit 3: if you are truly interested, I would recommend reading Jill Furmanovskys book, Was There Then. It will diespel a lot of the notions that they didnt try, or it wasnt planned out, or they were drugged up lunatics during the recording. Thats simply a myth perpetuated by sheepEdit 4:  Lol, I'm a year younger than Noel. You are reading too much into this. We were all off our faces back then. I saw them at a small pub in Stoke in the early days and at Knebworth. Your opinion is valid and I'm glad you like the music. However in my opinion the first two albums were what made them iconic to some of us. Others couldn't stand them. Gotta love the 90s Lol okay my bad, youre right. I agreehonestly I like the first two albums better, but I hate this is the one that kinda ruined their public perception. I still think its great, albeit different.And you are so lucky to have witnessed that man. Im only 24 and say Noel last August with the Smashing Pumpkins. I totally missed out, but I guess I get to witness everything in hindsight and take it all in. Do you remember much about those shows you went to? Mate when I was your age I thought I'd missed out on the 60s bands like The Who, as I've said off our faces back then, but I did get ripped off at Knebworth, bought some bits of paper that were supposed to be trips ( acid ).

Constructed for Justinianus I, the Byzantium Emperor (527-565), this big underground water reservoir is called as Yerebatan Cistern among the public because of the underground marble columns. As there used to be a basilica in the place of the cistern, it is also called Basilica Cistern.The cistern is 140 m long, and 70 m wide, and covers a rectangular area as a giant structure. Accessible with 52-step staircase, the Cistern shelters 336 columns, each of which is 9 m high. Erected at 4.80 m intervals from one another the columns are composed of 12 rows, each has 28 columns. The case-bay of the cistern is conveyed by the columns through arches. Majority of the columns, most of which is understood to have been compiled from the ancient structures and sculpted of various kinds of marbles, is composed of a single part and one of it is composed of two parts. The head of these columns bear different features in parts. 98 of them reflect the Corinthian style and part of them reflect the Dorian style. The cistern has 4.80 m high brick walls, and the floor is covered by bricks, and plastered by a thick layer of brick dust mortar for water tightness. Covering 9,800 sqm area in total, the cistern has an estimated water storage capacity of 100,000 tons. That looks like the river of slime from Ghostbusters 2. yes you're right, but this served a better purpose. :)"}, {"id": "cb3kxi", "caption": "Swab a Cheek   , Save a Life | Join the Gift of Life Marrow Registry", "image_hash": "q0fw2rp47b931.jpg", "text": " Maybe I'm weird but this just seems like a bad idea for conspiracy reasons.

From one father to another my son has 5 heart conditions which will eventually require him to get a heart transplant; the conditions are an ASD, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,heart trabeculations, pericardial effusio, and accessory pathways. We found out about three of his conditions shortly after his first birthday and since then it's been a constant struggle just to keep him stable. He weighs only 15 pounds and wears 9-12 month clothing as he won't grow, for reasons we don't know yet. This last Wednesday he went in for his first exploratory surgery to get real time data and pictures inside his heart and his lungs as his O2 levels also frequently drop to the low 80s, the operation went fine but when the surgery was done the clot from the insertion site migrated Into his leg and cut off the circulation. Given how small he is they can not operate to remove the clot, and he is on quadruple the dose of anticoagulants for his size. He was on IV heparin and now hes on Lovenox injections on top of the 5 oral medications he's already normally taking just to keep him stable. He is not on the transplant list yet because they haven't found the cause for his conditions so they're worried a new heart at this point would just gain the same defects he currently has (minus the ASD) so the goal is to keep him stable long enough for him to grow and figure out where in his genes these problems originate to treat the cause prior to the transplant. This isn't the first extended hospital stay and we know it won't be the last, especially given how his cardiologist is fairly positive he will be inpatient later up until his number comes up on the transplant list. Im lost for words. I wish your family and this little guy all the best. From one father to another this breaks my heart. My prayers go to you and your little man. I sincerely wish you and your family the best. Stay strong Sir. Damn I couldn't imagine how hard that is. I'll keep you guys in my prayers. Thank you! Wow, you are going through a lot at the moment. I really hope you'll find the cause for his conditions soon and get to the transplant list!You are doing amazing, keep it up and good luck! Thank you! Thank you!

By the artist framing this as a critique of late stage capitalism, it both denies the equivalent pollution and waste that occurs in other systems and leaves the viewer with the impression that the artist (or poster) was trying to make a more political than social statement. **were lovin it**Our current social arrangement makes us feel like shit. It is taking its toll on the world we live in as well as on our selves.Capital exploits and runs our life-forces to the ground, extracts value from our personhood, zombifies us, pollutes and degrades our minds and very being, shortens our attention span, and limits the parameters of our imagination and our capacity to think up better worlds.There is no longer any distinction between life and work. We are always producing surplus-value; we are always at the ready to answer a work email or call, and we generate data in our leisure time as we upload, check in, share and like. And yet most of us now find ourselves chronically underpaid or underemployed.We have never seemed so connected, yet we find ourselves increasingly separated and atomised, alone, anxious and paranoid, pitted against each other and against other others, viciously competing for crumbs.Even those who materially profit from the current social structure are wounded by it, enslaved by its poisonous logic and bound to its so-called rational imperative of endless accumulation.Were faced by the seemingly infinite choice of goods and services to satisfy our needs, and we mistake this choice for freedom as we blindly trudge through the landscapes of late capitalism, the piles of rotting rubbish and putrid waste it discharges and the ruins it leaves in its wake, a planet scarred by the devastation it wrecks upon it and scorched by the never-ending wars it wages.

This stuff gives me an ungodly amount of nostalgia, and I would hate to see it be unappreciated I think a real estate agent will press hard for your family to disassemble the setup and clear the basement before it goes on the market.  Having the basement basically unusable except for model railroading will have 95%+ of prospective buyers walking away.  Or will lower the sales price substantially, to cover the cost of demolition and disposal.  From a home sales perspective this is a liability, not an asset.Document the hell out of it, it's an awesome layout. You should be selling a model train set with house attached. Sadly, theres a 99% chance that will all get ripped out, and tossed. I would guess that someone who's into model trains would want to build their own setup.

You've never even met the guy and you're assuming he's trafficking based off of his looks? I think you're confused. He just wants less humans in traffic so his job as a driver is easier. One of the things I've noticed in life is that I trust bikers and truckers more then most. They are honest and honorable id rather be fighting with  someone with their colors and patches than against. Rescuing them from other truckers.

Take a blue jay feather and hold it up to a light or the sun and youll see the feather is actually brown. But when light bounces off of it you see blue. If I recall correctly there is one blue butterfly which has actual blue pigments though.

Why cant we just go slaughter everyone in foster care  \"Ever notice how most of the people who are against abortion are people you wouldn't want to fuck in the first place?\" -George Carlin  Seen this on reddit earlier.

Lets see how commited you are to this premise. \"She can't come in.\"\"She was 96, she got hit by a bus.\"\"There's options.\"- Bill Hicks  one way or another, isn't that what we do? I love that you put this here  It expresses a valid point though, unless you're pro life of course. It's better to try and provide a home then to not. Everyone is able to do what they can do. It's not as if there are a line of people who would like a feces thrower. Sometimes bonding with families can be huge triggers for kids and you have to have boundaries for your own family's sake. I get what you're saying but one foster family can have a huge impact on hundreds of kids lives. IF they don't become burnt out and guilt ridden early on because wanting so badly to help and realizing we are all just human can be very hard. Shaming people for making hard decisions like those is damaging to foster care as a whole.

Do you have a darker pencil? It would pop even more if your blacks were really black. That's what held my art back the most when I started- I wasn't going dark enough to get the range of shades to really take it to the next level. Very nice but you're being timid regarding shading as you feel like you'll lose the detail in the shadows.The dog is much darker than in your drawing.Do a squint test (which effectively alters brightness AND contrast), the photo goes almost entirely black and the drawing maintains high brightness. For reference, the light brown fur in your drawing is portrayed at the same shade as the white patch on the lower neck. it should be darker.Also the highlights in the black fur should be smaller and thinner.Finally, the chain drafting needs some tightening up, it's mushy and not crisp Trying to? Seriously? This is incredible Django may actually be the coolest name for a dog I've ever heard OP, I used to draw realistic portraits, and a really good tip would be to turn your image black and white and try to get the values of EVERYTHING as close as you can to the original image, including the background. some parts of your drawing are too white/too dark.

So, how many in a Kit Kat bar? I see 1 illusion What is super bowl? Then you switch perspectives and begin investigating how such a fucked up thing can exist.  there is always two sides of the story journalists are meant to tell us the truth but.... Serj said it best No.  If you and someone else look at 9/6 and he says it's a \"6\", not a \"9\", the answer is not to say \"That's, like, your opinion, man...\" and break into a talk about perspective.  Look around. Are there other numbers that you can infer the direction from? Is there anyone who lives there whom you can ask if that's a 6 or a 9? Find the person who painted the 9/6, or the city council document that approved it.  It's true that there are fundamental ideas that are a matter of perspective and have no other explanation than \"it just is - take it or leave it\", but most things people argue about are not like this: they are just issues, with reasons behind them of why it would be 6 and not 9, and reasons why it *should* be 6 and not 9, and consequences on the broader world of picking 6 and not 9, that can be sometimes measured.    The fact that debating is difficult and in some cases purely impossible isn't a reason to stop doing it. Stopping is stagnation. Debate, people. What is sicko mode? For me this is about being so stuck in your own opinion that you completely disregard others opinions, one sees a 6/9 or 3 bars or 4 as OP posted. Ive had people in a class who refuse to back down on this point, they see a 6, there is no debate until you shift their perspective. My message is, be open to making that initial shift, then we can encourage debate, discussion and dialogue, open up conversations and see as manys views as possible.

I believe they call that \"Docking\" It's not gay if the balls don't touch Sword fight!! Stop dicking around, son. The biting words of his disapproving father rang out in the young mans memory.He only saw his father at Christmas, when the boarding school would send students home to be with their families. The year was 1910 and Cambridge, Massachusetts was covered in a thick blanket of snow. And though he came from exorbitant wealth, young Albert always had a knack for homemade gifts. And every year, without fail, his father would half-remove the heartfelt creation from the paper wrapping before setting it aside with a tired sigh.Christmas Eve was when their family would exchange gifts and Albert, now a grown man, distinctly remembered the dim glow of firelight  that lit his fathers face year after year. His staple attire of wool slacks and bland sweater vests. The tower of Latin textbooks from his time as a professor at Harvard. The sound of impossibly thick ss made by the mouth of a man too in love with his pipe to ever set it down. And, especially, the night this near-stranger of a father glanced over the top of his horn-rimmed glasses toward Albert: Quit dickin around, son. Youll never be a man at this rate. You hear me? Never.This sentiment would come to define young Albert as he worked tirelessly for the affection of a man who would never give it; the distance of decades utterly incapable of removing the grip Alberts father had around his sense of worth.And then, one sunny afternoon while his own son napped, a letter arrived.Come home, Albert. Father is dying. Its cancer.Having traveled the many miles between them at the request of his grieving mother, despite his own abjection, Albert - by now a renowned clothier among New Englands wealthiest - was naturally tasked with choosing his fathers grave clothes.How does one dress a man, wealthy as he, whose legacy is little more than a promise of failure??? he bellowed one night into the roaring flames of the fireplace from his fathers old Bergere.Hed toss page after crumpled page into the fire as he worked into the early hours of the morning, trying, it seemed in vain, to honor his mothers request.At long last, just as the sun began to stir on the horizon, a half grin licked his lips like the flames on his every abandoned sketch: he had a plan.And come Tuesday morning, his father was laid to rest in the wool slacks and otherwise bland sweater vest of Alberts childhood save for the subtle, passably modest design knitted into the vests front. And on the tag, Albert hand stitched the name of his famous brand:*Numquam*(Edit: changed two words for continuity and grammatical correctness) Looks normal to me 2 dicksss Reminds me of the runes from the movie Midsommer.

I bet these people don't return their cart to the corral either. Does anyone who does this not already know they are an a hole?

Yeah man this bike was expensive in 1984. It was my early 8th grade graduation gift. I laughed like hell when you mentioned your Bruce Lee flying kick lol That's funny. Good thing you noticed that guy taking your brother's bike. Oddly enough I forgot that mine was stolen from my back porch, just like you said. I grew up in a quiet small town, but by shear luck a friend of mine, Freshman year, knew who stole it and I went home told my dad, who called the cops and we got it back. Thank God because I was majorly distraught lol It was a friggin' scene. total commotion. it was right in between races and every one was heading to the food stands. he wouldnt have gotten far with it more than likely, he was the only one in town with a bike that even looked like that. and they all were tricked out in different ways.  but yeah felt pretty good. i was taking martial arts classes at the time. and my instructor was in the audience with his kid. next time in class he asked me why i couldnt do it in class and every one laughed. he was a huge proponent of never actually using it out side of competition.  and then he says, *but, that was pretty cool*"}, {"id": "ecrlqv", "caption": "The cat is amused too", "image_hash": "0ooqzps6lk541.jpg", "text": " Is this from assam protest?
