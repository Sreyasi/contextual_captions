Well then I have some magic beans Id like to sell you. Beep beep boop boop troll \"Would you buy a used car from this man?\" Hey if 'triggering the libs' is what you like to do in your spare time i respect that, but i think its pretty silly. Maybe im reading too far into it but im pretty sure thats the intention of your post and although i disagree with it, i dont see anything particularly wrong with it. From what ive seen from a lot of trump supporters, most of what they do is to incite an emotional response out of people and then use the reaction to discredit that person. Sadly, simple and more sensitive people who are quick to outrage fall for it all the time, so there us much sport to be had. Again, if messin with the more sensitive folks in this country entertains you then i wouldnt be much of an american if told you that you shouldnt do what you enjoy. I caution that this growing sentiment of \"everyone being so sensitive nowadays\" seems really suspect in the sense that it seems to be another tool to divide people further.Everyone has things that they happen to be more sensitive about and its integral to discourse to just generally try to not be a dick on purpose. Its fun and sometimes too easy to fuck with people and im often guilty of it as well. Sometimes i like to joke to my republican coworkers about how many abortions ive had and how good fetuses taste out the deep fryer, just to see how flustered they get. This is weakness on my part and i think it removes the possibility of polite discourse. Its also the reason why i think its silly to adopt the act of triggering people you disagree with as a part of your political identity. There's many organizations that wish to profit off of you and I hating one another instead of disagreeing peacefully. I refuse to do that because i believe are right to disagree is why america is great, past, future and present.

So can you give me the link to prove it?I dont see the news you mentioned ,and I search it already.It is because China love fake news and the news you read is fake,firstly Hong Kong only have 8 universities,and there was only 2 universities was attacked by polices,and others was very peaceful and nothing happenedI must understand deeply than you as I live in Hong Kong right now. So that this is cancelled the classes only,but not because the mobs destroy the university.the other 8 colleges cancelled because traffic and protests outside.even one of university announced to cancel class last night for the preparation of today protest. And the main reasons of these universities is that the polices went inside the school and released tear gas.In polyu, after polices release tear gas,they announced to cancel class.In CU,after polices went inside university,they announced cancel class immediately.not because themobsdestroy school.Moreover,there is no any security to protect student today when polices went inside and attack student!!!!therefore,student set road block and set fire to prevent polices go insideIn polyu,some student destroy universities facilities because they irritated.The principal of polyu do nothing when lots students was arrest was hit by polices.he dont protect students.even polices was attacking student inside the school,he just cancel the class until 2pm.Although such emergency circumstances,he still want student go back school ,he did not consider students safety and care students."}, {"id": "c7wxn3", "caption": "Crystal clear raindrops on a dragonfly", "image_hash": "VFkoOcp.jpg", "text": " With extra saturated color!

Ill love you forever  .", "image_hash": "sm0g0tx7h5h41.jpg", "text": " So sorry for your loss I found this on the internet years ago after I had a particularly hard time with the loss of my first dog living on my own. I hope it helps your heart as it did mine.It came to me that every time I lose a dog they take a piece of my heart with them, and every new dog who comes into my life gifts me with a piece of their heart. If I live long enough, all the components of my heart will be dog, and I will become as generous and loving as they are.                          ~Anonymous~ Sorry for your loss pal. Keep your chin up. Just some words that consoled me when my best friend passed.... Sorry for your lossBut there is one best place to bury a dog. If you bury him in this spot, he will come to you when you call - come to you over the grim, dim frontiers of death, and down the well remembered path, and to your side again. And though you call a dozen living dogs to heel they shall not growl at him, nor resent his coming, for he belongs there. People may scoff at you who see no lightest blade of grass bend by his footfall, who hear no whimper, people who may never really have had a dog. Smile at them, for you shall know something that is hidden from them, and that is well worth the knowing. The one best place to bury a good dog is in the heart of his master.    - Bun Hur Lampman -So this is where we part, My Friend,   and you'll run on, around the bend,   gone from sight, but not from mind,   new pleasures there you'll surely find.   I will go on, I'll find the strength,   life measures quality, not its length.   One long embrace before you leave,   share one last look, before I grieve.   There are others, that much is true,   but they be they, and they aren't you.   And I, fair, impartial, or so I thought,   will remember well all you've taught.   Your place I'll hold, you will be missed,   the fur I stroked, the nose I kissed.   And as you journey to your final rest,   take with you this...I loved you best. - Jim Willis - Mine had cancer and I know hes better off but dammit Im selfish and wanted him to live forever...Im sorry for your loss May he rest in peace. Dont worry youre buddy is up in heaven chasing squirrels I have a pupper waiting for me too...honestly it was harder than I thought to see him go  I recently went through this with one of my childhood dogs. I am thinking of both you and your buddy. Rest easy good boy. I'm so sorry. He's got a bunch of pals to greet him.  Since I lost my two little girls (cats/sisters) in a fire back in 2017, I always say that I wished more than anything that the Rainbow Bridge had visiting hours, it's not fair. We love them so much, and one day they're just not there anymore and it leaves such a terrible emptiness behind. Like they took a part of you with them, and nothing helps that kind of pain but time. I'm so sorry you lost your baby, but something that happened to me last year that made me believe that they come visit us even if we don't know it. I'd moved into my mother's house after my place burnt down, and my mother had no animals. But I was lying awake facing the wall with just about enough space for another person in between the wall and me. Suddenly I feel this weight at the end of the bed, that weight you feel when they jump up to get in bed with you. I didn't move and just held still...and I felt these teeny tiny, almost weightless footsteps one at a time, walk up to the space next to where I was laying my head...and then the weight settled there. I know I wasn't dreaming either because I got up out of bed afterwards to go to downstairs to the bathroom. So I know that's just my story, but I hope it brings you comfort and maybe some hope, because it certainly helped me to believe they really were still here somewhere. Much love you too, and your little bud, wherever he/she may be."}, {"id": "a2qh2r", "caption": "Sunset in snowtracks", "image_hash": "o934j9zff3221.jpg", "text": "  stop spamming this picture from 9 months ago for karma...1.[Snow tracks in the sunset.](submitted 17 hours ago by [\\_NITRISS\\_]( to [/r/oddlysatisfying](100% similar - 700 x 990 - 112 kB**52838 points**  **249 comments**2.[Tracks on the snow](submitted 9 months ago by [Bongnazi]( to [/r/oddlysatisfying](99.88% similar - **1357 x 1920** (276% bigger) - 198 kB**46629 points**  More info to this reposted pic:  [Karmadecay.com]( beautiful shot!

I was seriously waiting for him to come alive at any moment but.. he was confirmed deceased. Hitting him around Midnight a hour and a half from home on a  completely dark highway was terrifying! So, according to NC highway patrol it is illegal to move a bear.. I assume after it's been hit by a car?  They called wildlife to remove him from the roadway but I'm pretty sure one of the volunteers from the Fire Department that responded went back for it after we all left. To be honest.. the bear smelt so badly.. I wouldn't of taken it.

It was more than a million students all over the country. The media is making it seem like it wasn't that big but it really was. And they soon won't be able to hide it anymore. Algerian living in the United States here, the protests aren't just about president bouteflika running his 5th term. But also about the whole governmental system in general. Bouteflika is currently in his 80s and is physically very unfit to lead, there were presidental term limits in Algerian but Bouteflika got rid of them when his term ran out. Since the late 90s the same group of people have been running the government. Bouteflika suffered a stroke in 2013 and is unable to walk or speak, leading many to believe a shadow government called \"the power\" is secretly calling the shots. Boteflikas candidacy wasn't just the cause of the protests but more like the straw that broke the camel's back since the Algerian people would have had to deal with 5 more years of this bullshit.  Algeria is witnessing a revolution while local and national media is ignoring the events. Manifestations all around the country everyday by the thousands, all against the election of  Abd Elaziz Bouteflika for a fifth term of presidency (since 1999).[The 22nd Feb 2019]([The 24th Feb 2016 Algerians living in France (paris)]([Students the 26th Feb 2016](All this while the local and national media are turning their backs as if nothing is happening.Another national manifestations are expected the 1st of March.I hope the message of the millions of Algerians me included gets heard I also hope it puts more pressure on the actual government  .*: the only updated link i've found of today's events is from a national media group that everyone here is boycotting, but it gets the message crossed, every other media outlet (even the public ones) has started covering the events today as a move to keep their credibility or at least what is left of it. Revolution:  a forcible overthrow of a government or social order, in favour of a new system.You might want to change your words. These are peaceful protests. We don't want another \"spring\" in here. Didn't know Algeria is still a country.  They must not have oil.\\-America  You are right, this isnt getting the attention it deserves To be honest, as one of these protesters, we kindly don't care about the media    Internationally, 1st because the Revolution is going well underway, everyday a new layer of the society joins the movement, the pro-regime are not seen at all on the streets, the police is doing a surprising good job, the military is in its rightful place (their bases) we are going with this until the \"Presidential Mafia\" goes away.The international media coverage may complicate things, because the regime may use every bit of it to threaten society.Also, we don't want France to get involved more than this, especially their media, both their government and their Media ignored our people's fate in the last 20 years, they allied themselves with the regime just to keep their advantages.  Is this going to turn Algeria into another Libya? Cause that would be terrible. Algeria has dealt with a lot of strife since the French leaving. But actually since the Roman times. Hopefully it works out so the people can have a better system of government  What are you talking about? the first algerian newspaper i looked up has [this]( as its top story right now. how are you going to claim algerian news isn't talking about it? its also being covered in world news btw, in case you want to move the goalposts.

Just like everything nice, if it gets abused, it doesn't last. Also the idea that was conveyed in the SoL is not why people are coming here now. They are coming here now for the free stuff.If they have a baby in the US, they get money for that kid. If they get hurt they get free medical care at the ER. It's not just the land if opportunity anymore, it's the land of free shit. If we as the US got rid of the welfare state, and people just came here to work,  I would have no problem with as many people coming as we could handle. The problem is that they leave their homes because there is no work, they come here and abuse the welfare state. Then when they get the chance to vote (legally or illegally) they vote for the same policies and politicians that put their own country in the hole. just imagine if we supported the president.....hmm-mm Libs like to take things out of context, or just make it up.  If you don't love this country go back where you came from. NOT racist, just common sense. Such a cynical, bullshit comment seemingly based primarily on right-wing propaganda. Please provide your statistics on your free stuff claim. Most studies indicate that immigration has a net positive affect on the economy. They get free er visits now? Bravo !!!!  Well put!!! Unpopular and wrong. Why do liberal taxes have to support conservative red states? Get off your lazy asses instead of taking handouts. Right! How could we even ask that when currently the US isn't even responsible for the wellbeing of it's own people? So I am a big fan of the truth. The other commentators are partially correct. 1 He did say it to US citizens who in this case are not white. 2 the whole quote is \"if you hate our country, if you're not happy here, you can leave\"  The group of congressmen in question are 4  women of color called the \"the squad\".

There is no equality for these people in America? How are the lacking in equality? Do you have any examples? So what specific concrete changes are they hoping will be enacted as a result of their march? For people of color, no. Theres a long history in America about red lining districts, gerrymandering, police discrimination, police brutality, equal representation under the law, rental housing discrimination, voter disenfranchisement, and more stuff that I cant get to in full over some comments on an Internet forum. Some of which are institutionally built in to the system to this day.For women, their challenges are a little more unique and more so corresponds with how gender roles are perceived since practically time immemorial. It can range from the gender pay gap, the pink tax, reproductive rights and more stuff like that. People want to go out and have a career, make a name for themselves, and represent themselves better in the world around them.Gender is a new one for me. Im not fully educated upon all of their grievances. To the best of my knowledge, it mainly revolves around making people understand that sex and gender or two separate things and are not just one word that mean the other word. Im sure its more complicated than that, but like I said, Im not as fully steeped in it. Gender is about how one identifies as, sex is about the parts that you were born with.Not to mention, this current president and administration in general is not exactly helping to solve any of these problems. Now that its an election year, people are seeing their window of change. Its only a matter of time before people make hope for change become the reality.

Its true though; capitalism is pretty good at a community level, but gets super fucked up at a global level. Climate change for example, a lot of emissions is due to consumerism from Western, nationally developed states. (Global North vs Global South) An economic system is **not** a form of government. You can still have Capitalism with regulations in place. Russia produces one of the highest emissions in the world. The US is near the top in ramping down emissions. What you said is simply put untrue How realistic is that though? Ok, youre taking this out of context. I used a global level of analysis while youre now looking at it through a state level of analysis. The US and Russia are in the same hemisphere and pretty much all developed states are in the Global North (relatively speaking). Due to colonialism, these northern states have leeched the global south of resources to further their own interests. Hence, the global capitalistic system is the very reason that allows for incredibly high amounts of emissions as we transition from a carbon-based society to a zero-waste/emission society, a process that takes enormous amounts of time. I meant the US is ramping DOWN emissions. Most emissions come from animals thats how climate change is a natural process."}, {"id": "fk417g", "caption": "idk some photo i took of some cliff i made using wood", "image_hash": "9wskirrq28n41.jpg", "text": " God?

The nearest wild bird rehab was even further and we had no phones (this is before cell phones were a thing) .So the remaining 2 weeks we were up there we kept him in a shelter made of wood and chicken wire and every day me and my sister would go down to the lake and fish for small bass and bluegill and bring them up to him. We named him Cody. At the end of our time up there we took him with us back to town and called the nearest wildlife rescue. They took him in and for a number of years would take him around to the local gradeschools (he was very tame by this point since we'd had him for so long and so early) to teach them about raptors. eventually he got some sort of injury and they had to perform a surgery to fix it.

Rip chungus What die he use to make this? It looks awesome! I saw he has an Etsy shop, you should warn him that Copyright laws are very strictly enforced on there, both by Etsy itself and all the tattle tales who will try to get his shop removed. Warner Bros won't care if the work is derived or not and will take down the listing if they ever catch wind of it. Same with almost half the listings in the shop. He might get away with it longer if he renames them to things like Hunter and Wabbit or something but even then that's no guarantee he wont get caught. Best of luck to him though! IMO his own website would be best for displaying his derived/copyright-infringing arts and going forward, if he wants to make money off his talent, he'll need to redirect his energy towards more original works. Sorry, hate being that guy but the same thing happened to me when I started selling on Etsy and I had no idea!

If you want to be \"specific\" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.If you're saying \"swan family\" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Corvidae, which includes things from nutcrackers to blue jays to ravens.So your reasoning for calling an egret a swan is because random people \"call the white ones swans?\" Let's get grackles and blackbirds in there, then, too.Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. An egret is an egret and a member of the swan family. But that's not what you said. You said an egret is a swan, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the swan family swans, which means you'd call blue jays, ravens, and other birds swans, too.

But when they cant choose where they want to be, thats called captivity. (goes for both humans and animals)A bird in a cage is human selfishness. A fish in a tank is human selfishness. A cat in an apartment is human selfishness.

I' have about 10\" or less under mine. I clear out a lot of larger leaves once it goes to flower, train them to spread and top them through out veg. You would get better airflow away from the house a bit. Also the white house reflects a lot of light so your production would be better if you were a few feet off the house. Moving from the back corner to the front corner next season should help. Agreed. It's not the most ideal location, but it was the one with the best soil. I hear that. It's why I grow in bags. You have a nice garden. Have you ever looked into worm farming? I have a small set up, one of the 4 tier tray systems. You feed in the top tray and when it is full, about a month of weekly food scraps and coffee grounds, you start another tray above it. When you have 4 trays running and it's time for the next level, you harvest worm casting from the bottom tray and start it back up on the top. My critters eat 5 to 8 lbs of food a week. I'm getting about a gallon bag worth of casting a month. Super food for plants. All of your soil will be black gold come spring. I store  the gallon bags of castings through the winter and add them to my beds and bags in the spring. All that goodness with no stink at all. The farm is in my living room. Best pets ever.

It depends on the bird itself not the type of bird what u should is that you take the egg and put it under a flashlight in a dark room if u see veins in the egg then its is fertile but if it was just a yellow circle in the middle then it is infertile. Reference from [the Spruce]( website on how birds mate. When birds are ready to breed, their reproductive organs, the testes and ovaries, swell and produce the sperm and ova. Male birds store sperm in their cloaca until an opportunity to mate arises, and females will receive that sperm into their cloaca before it travels deeper into their bodies to fertilize their ova and begin egg formation. Of course after all the mother is the one who feeds it"}, {"id": "d88iq7", "caption": "I painted Post Malone", "image_hash": "x2xbqfqt9do31.jpg", "text": " Pink Orange Blue and Purple Iverson Fr though this is really well done, good work with the layering and clean lines.

I mean, not me personally, but in terms of getting the 9/11 bills past, Mitch McConnell has been the white whale of this since 2010. In 2010 -- you know, and this brings up something, because I think it's -- it's the cynicism that's displayed by Washington that also causes this situation to be so emotional. They asked Mitch McConnell about the testimony after it was done and he said, oh the, gosh -- I think he used the word gosh. Gosh, we haven't looked at that in a while, but we will look at it and I'm sure we'll deal with it as compassionately as we have in the past.> > But I want to make it clear that this has never been dealt with compassionately by Senator McConnell. He has always held out until the very last minute. And only then, under intense lobbying and public shaming, has he even deigned to move on it. This is not a Republican-Democrat issue. There are Republicans on the bill. We'd obviously like to have more of them. But Senator McConnell has seen fit to -- in 2010 he used it to make sure that the Bush tax cuts would be permanent. In 2015, he took it out of the transportation bill because he wanted to extract some promises on oil imports. And so in -- in this bill right now, in 2019, he's been aware of this -- we were told in August that this fund was running out of money and that people were going to have their awards slashed by 30, 50, up to 70 percent. It's crazy that it needed a celebrity to fight, tooth and nail to make sure that USA didn't shit all over the heroes of 9/11 ....Imagine what sort of signal that sends to the rest of the world, if a celebrity hadn't joined the fight they would've drowned in medical bills or simply die. That is definitely not something a true 1st world country would do... I miss Jon Stewart so fucking much Nailed it!  Bless this man. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!

The way that bokeh works (blurriness of out of focus objects) is that everything that is the same distance from the camera should have the same amount of blur, and the blur makes a gradual transition depending on distance from focal distance.  It makes no sense for the grass on the center right to be extremely blurry when its right in front of the in-focus grass and next to the front center deer, which is in focus.On top of that, the grass on the left is also just weirdly blurred out.  I'm not sure what tool he used but it's just completely unnatural looking bokeh, even worse than the smartphone algorithms. This is blurred in photoshop. The area between the leopards legs is farther away than the leopard. It should be less blurred but it isn't.Edit. Also this is shot with a telephoto lens. Everything in the photo should be over 100 ft away and all equally clear or blurry. Well, the top half is nice. The bottom is *way* too blurred in photoshop and the division between blurred and sharp is not gradual enough. When I first looked at this I thought the cat was some weird shadow.

Was a fair afternoon with my great friend and fellow photographer [Valter Joannas]( , suddenly a very violent thunderstorm is literally fallen upon us. We have found refuge in a cave on the side of the mountain waiting the storm passing. I have said to Valter watching outside, \" Nice scene\", reply \" we must shoot\".I have called this shot Descent to Rivendell, because remebered me the great master piece by John Howe with the same title.,Enrico Fossati (Sep 25, 2014) This is in taken from a mountain called Le Bout du Monde(end of the world) at the end of the Sixt Fer a Cheval valley in the Grand Massif, France. I've hiked here in the Autumn and there must be a dozen waterfalls on each side. Some of which you can stand under and drink from. In the winter you can ski tour along and up but it has a ridiculous number of avalanches each year so its actually banned. I've met a few people that have risked it and say its just as beautiful in the snow. Beautiful Where was this taken? I want to go! Shouldnt it be Ascent from Rivendell? this photo is pretty descent I thought that said \"Riverdale\" and was rather confused for a moment. My neighborhood is called Rivendell, it doesnt look anything like that. This isn't Rivendell. As we all know, Rivendell is based on Lauterbrunnen/ Wengen in Switzerland.

That fucker is going DOWN Can we allow cuts this one time? Some context for the photo, judging by the things I could see:This is a grade school in Turkey (ballots are always cast in schools). On the left is the \"school health announcement board\" (Turkish: okul saglk panosu) warning students to \"think twice before consuming/drinking\" (icerken tekrar dusun!). The bags show (I think) how much sugar is in each drink: ayran (Turkish salty yogurt drink), milk, coke, iced tea (we're a tea country), juice and chocolate milk. Below it is another panel that says \"My good deed that made me happy this month:\", but I can't read anything else in that one.On the right is the \"history of our school\" but I can't read anything there. It mentions the Ministry of Education, etc. Probably mundane stuff.The people show a pretty good cross section of the country. The bride almost certainly votes left-wing (so her party won this election, yay). The women next to her are difficult to tell -- the \"stink eye\" woman (who might have just been unlucky with camera timing) could vote either way, and while the old lady next to her does have a headscarf (usually a religious sign, likely conservative), old women do wear headscarves for traditional reasons (it's worn in a slightly different style, but I can't tell from this angle). The guy looks very \"standard\", in the sense that I can't see any signs of his political preference (a mustache would help).Edit: As of political importance, this is the first political victory of the left wing in approximately 20 years. Getting elected as Mayor of Istanbul (as Erdogan did back in 1994) is considered a pathway to Presidency, and the immense amount of money managed by the municipality (I think it has a budget of $40B) determines a lot of power relationships between the government and some companies led by pro-government people. These companies sadly include a lot of news broadcasters, so it's difficult to find impartial coverage (funnily enough, the Turkish branch of Fox News is currently the only mainstream channel that could be considered \"fair\", i.e. willing to call out the government from time to time). she's got my vote So, if you've a bride in Constantinople, she'll be waiting in Istanbul. Even in Turkey they can't escape COMIC SANS Look at that stank eye in the background My daughter just got back from Istanbul.

The new head fits almost perfectly! I had to get my thyroid removed about 10 years ago. Due to a lump but turned out not to be cancer. Until you get your hormone levels right you might feel like garbage but it will get better. At least the hormones themselves are cheap. Cancer just got cancelled. My gf had half her thyroid removed. That whole ordeal was terrifying. It went something like this:GF: I have a lump in my throat.DOC: Yes. But don't worry. It's probably not cancerous. Let's run some tests.DOC: Well the tests were inconclusive but we saw some worrying signs. There's probably a 50% chance it's malignant. We need to get you in for a biopsy.DOC: We can't be totally sure, but at this point it's 99% cancer. We're gonna go in and remove it.SURGERYDOC: We tested the growth after removal. It wasn't cancerous.Not fun. Don't recommend. Dude what kind? I also had thyroid cancer and had two surgeries to get it removed. It is so awesome to find another guy around my same age that I can relate to in this way!!Was it follicular??And congrats for getting it taken care of man!!

It has a epidermis slide in it that's blue but the camera doesn't pick up the slide so it just looks like a tunnel Do you know why? Do you want to know why? Why? Going to take a quick guess and say that OP took this photo with a cell phone (but even if it was a digital camera the issue would be the same).  The Cellphone camera requires a certain minimum distance for focus, and more than likely was set to Auto. It therefore focused on the ocular piece of the microscope, as you can see the [eyepiece pointer]( in the photo. So basically the image of the epidermis is out of focus in the background white spot, which is also way over exposed so that it only looks white. The microscope itself is a series of lenses, and then you are trying to take a photo using another series of lenses in your camera. If the focal planes for both series of lenses are not lined up correctly, you are not going to be able to take a picture of what you want. The microscope is basically set to focus the image into your eye, but the camera needs the focal plane to be \"X\" millimeters away from the lens. If you put the two together, its not going to work.   This is why microscope cameras are usually attached above the microscope with a specific length of tube, and not down the eyepiece.

They have some very strict rules to get in there.  Like, a baby which dies before it has a chance to be baptized doesnt get in, according to Catholics.  Now, it wouldnt go to hell but it doesnt get into heaven.  Thats purgatory, along with all the people who died but lived good lives before the word of Christ was spoken.(Not religious so I may have some of that wrong) heaven is north korea except kim can read your mind and tell if youre faking Hell has borders. They're circles. Hell must be better without stupid rules and no dumb borders everybody is welcome! So? Heaven is an exclusive club that you are trapped in for eternity with only the most pious Christians, while Hell has a come and go policy with the majority of it's occupants able to do most anything they want, even just walk away. Hmm.I wonder if Heaven also operates on racial exclusions also, and if not, I wonder how the Christian racists feel about all of the ethnicities getting into their exclusive club? What about Catholic priests who repent after molesting little boys for 40 years? They get in, right? They even let you pick your own daily pineapple enema You just have to accept Jesus as your Lord and Savior. That's it. You begin your walk with Jesus (up to your interpretation) that's your spiritual journey, but your faith is what gets you into heaven. Not much to do with your good deeds. Please read Matthew 20:116 Well since they repented their sins, yes. But don't get a divorce, seems that's worse then priests touching little boys. Pretty sure that's right.

But by doing that, you're ignoring, if not overriding, the very basic concept that people should be treated with respect because THEY'RE PEOPLE. I keep seeing this guy's picture in different scenarios holding different signs. Is this guy like some kind of professional sign meme maker? Gotta get my daily dose of sign with words on it. Picture of guy holding sign she's 100% someones daughter. What is the context? I completely agree with the sentiment expressed here. Women are important to society and should be valued as such, completely equally with men.However, I do feel here that protesters like this man slightly miss the point in order to be evocative.  Of course women aren't defined solely by their relationships with men. However, when the \"someone's \\[sister/mother/daughter/wife\\]\" sentiment is used, it usually is *intended* to convey their relationship to the people inferred.  For example, people have in the past used nearly the exact same sentence to refer to (traditionally) male soldiers \"he's someone's \\[brother/father/son/husband\\].  By this, people do not intend to mean that they are solely the object of their relationship to women, but rather are individuals who are cared about/important to a number of people in a greater community.  By misrepresenting the original intent of the phrase, individuals like this poster devalue the role of relationships in the wholistic definition of a person, which I see as a mistake."}, {"id": "a9jk4h", "caption": "T-Posing in a panorama", "image_hash": "g9o01xzbii621.jpg", "text": " Elongated l o n g  I am intimidated "}, {"id": "f4kx21", "caption": "Turning thrift shop finds into interesting displays  .", "image_hash": "dq5gaur6i7h41.jpg", "text": " What is the tortoise made out of?

It shows the moment a teenage stowaway fell to his death when the aeroplane wheel-well he was hiding inside opened in mid-air.Keith Sapsford, from Sydney, was just 14 years old in 1970 when he climbed into the plane to 'see how the rest of the world lives'.The plane he fell out of was bound for Japan. When the compartment opened mid-air, the youngster fell out above Sydney Kingsford Smith Airport, plummeting 60 metres (200ft).According to the MailOnline, the shot was captured 49 years ago this week by amateur photographer John Gilpin, who was taking pictures of planes during take-off.Mr Gilpin was completely oblivious to the fact that he had captured the young boy's last moments until he developed the pictures the following week.The child's family had just returned from a round-the-world trip which was believed to have been booked to satisfy his thirst for travel.On 23 February 1970, the Associated Press reported that his father, Charles Sapford, said: \"All my son wanted to do was to see the world. He had itchy feet. His determination to see how the rest of the world lives has cost him his life.\"Once the family returned from their travels, Keith had an 'urge to keep on the move' and was restless in their hometown of Randwick, New South Wales.This was when Charles made the decision to send his son to a Roman Catholic Institution in Sydney to 'straighten him out', but the young boy ran away a number of times.After only two weeks there, he travelled to Sydney Airport where he managed to get onto the runway and climb into the wheel-well of a Japan Air Lines plane destined for Tokyohe MailOnline reported that technicians believed the boy - who was dressed in shorts and a short-sleeved shirt - was unaware the latch would reopen after take-off to bring the wheel back inside, which is when he fell.According to doctors, Keith would have most likely died on the journey even without falling, due to the freezing altitude temperatures and lack of oxygen.Tragically, Charles Sapsford explained how he had previously spoken to Keith about a Spanish boy who died hiding inside the undercarriage of a plane just months before the incident.[Another article ]( Just looking at this picture makes my anxiety pop up and say, \"Well Hello!!!\" Talk about a terrible way to die. :("}, {"id": "ed84wn", "caption": "f's in the chat", "image_hash": "ppvj3p2dgr541.jpg", "text": " Oh ok I see it now.

Without thinking (obviously distracted by my current mood) I parked so poorly the car next to me couldn't get in and out of his car. My car was too close for that person to open the driver side door.While standing in line to pay for my items the guy I had blocked comes into the store and announces to everyone \"who is the asshole in the Honda that blocked me in?\"  He then went on a tirade about how \"whoever\" did that is a \"total piece of shit\"  and that \"you are not the only person in the world\".  He was just ranting to everyone in the store by the front door.I was standing pretty close to where his rant was going on and immediately apologized.  I was paying for my things and then he started ripping into me about how I was being even more selfish for continuing to pay for my items and not immediately moving the car.Obviously, my emotions were high as I was on the way to my grandma's funeral.  I am pretty calm guy and rarely lose my temper... but... given the situation I just unloaded on him.  Told him not everyone is an asshole on purpose, or selfish, and some people just make honest mistakes and that I was distracted because I was on my way to a funeral and that if the worst thing that happened to him today was being blocked in that I would trade places because I was on the  way to a funeral of a loved one.Told the guy to fuck off, grabbed my things, and moved my car.  Everyone in line applauded as I left.Moral of the story = don't be asshole, that \"jerk\" you're pissed off at may just be having a bad day and made an honest mistake. I would have just left a note threatening to do this if they continued parking this way. I did that once when a truck purposefully parked on the line of two spaces in our apartment complex where it was always difficult to find a place to park. It worked. No need for vandalism.

Corn.\"Sebastian sighed to himself and halfheartedly shooed away another crow. He received a spiteful \"caw\" and was alone again.\"You, too buddy.\" He wished he could express himself with a certain finger that scarecrows were, unfortunately, lacking.Sebastian had been outstanding in his field for almost a decade protecting a corn field. He never talked to anyone other than yelling back at angry crows. Most days anymore, he didn't even bother with that. He would watch the corn grow, see machines pass working the field, and the most time he spent with a person was being stood back up after getting knocked over by a careless tractor.\"It's not enough.\" He glanced at a nearby corn stalk, heavy with vegetables that would be ready for harvest soon.\"I stand here for months and just hope to get thrown to the ground for a few moments of human contact?\"The corn stalk did not respond.\"It's pathetic. I know.\" He slumped on his wooden stand. \"I'm pathetic.\"The vegetation around him swayed slightly in the breeze.\"No, I'm *not* pathetic. I just don't belong here! I need people. And excitement. I need more than this day after day.\"Sebastian the scarecrow spent the next weeks plotting. When harvest time came, he would have his chance. He waited patiently surveying the field and scaring off birds for what he hoped would be his last season.His moment came when the large, loud harvesting machine came by. In the past days he'd tried his best to loosen the pole he was fastened to. Rocking back and forth, back and forth, widening the hole in the soul until his stand had a pretty decent amount of wiggle room. Sebastian was hanging at a slant waiting to time it perfectly. He would shift his weight, catch himself on the harvester, get knocked down, and then he would run. He would run fast and far until the farm, the only place he knew, was a distant memory.The harvester came by. Sebastian threw honestly toeard it with all his might. The loud machine that shook the ground passed by so closely, but not close enough! The scarecrow only had one more pass, I've more chance for freedom.The harvester came back from the other direction. Sebastian threw himself hard toward the machine with horrible spinning parts that threatened to suck the poor scarecrow into it's jaws. He would come out in pieces to be sorted with the ears of corn. He had to try, though. He didn't even hesitate. He'd rather be silage than spend another season completely alone in the world. *CRACK*Sebastian's arm just caught the harvester as it passed. It broke the wooden pole he was on clean in two and threw him to the ground. He watched its huge wheels pass just inches from his face. \"Please, please, please let me be okay!\"He couldn't even hear his own cry over the sound of the giant machine as it passed. But then it did pass and Sebastian was okay! He struggled to free himself from the stand he was affixed to. It didn't take much, he'd been there without repairs for months. He was free. The lonely scarecrow was finally free.He laughed. Hysterically. He laughed until there were tears in his eyes. Freedom! So that's what it felt like. He felt so light just then. Like he was a balloon and would float up and up and up into the sky. But the rumbling of the farm equipment brought him back to the moment. He started running. Day and night he ran, afraid to stop anywhere near the farm where he was born. Would they look for him? No, they'd just make another. \"Or...\" he winced, \"replace me with plastic grocery bags on a stick.\" The thought hurt his pride a bit, but he couldn't let himself care. There was no going back. He was free!He ran until the scenery changed. Buildings, roads, cars, people, dogs on leashes, new sounds, new smells. It was incredible! He finally stopped to sit on a curb and take it all in.He looked up as someone left a building nearby. It was a person! Not a farmer. They looked very nice but Sebastian was so overwhelmed he couldn't speak. The nice person, seemingly amused, took his picture. Sebastian was glad that they had stopped even if he couldn't work up the nerve to say hello.Sebastian had been seen and acknowledged. It was the best day of the little scarecrow's life. Wow.

FOR THOSE WHO REALLY DON'T KNOW:  Old plastic \"floppy\" discs like this use a magnetically-charged film to hold the data. When another magnet is put too close to it like this, it causes the data to become scrambled and ruined by the interfering magnetic field, thus ruining the data on the disc.  This is sometimes done intentionally to destroy the data in a way machines cannot recover, a trick known as \"degaussing\". Sometimes this renders the disc unusable forever, other times they can be rewritten with new data. Floppy disk are like Jesus... They died to become the icon of saving That magnet is doing some nasty corruption to that system restore disk.  You probably wanna consider cleaning out your wardrobe.

Having that choice is important. Better a fetus be aborted than a baby born into an unhealthy family environment. But that is her decision, and we shouldn't take choice away from others because she regretted hers.  This is not brave. She practiced her legal right to an abortion, but because she regrets a decision that she herself made, no other woman should have that legal right? This is not bravery you're looking at... it's pure selfishness and ignorance. In this picture, the sign says this person regrets their abortion, but in a way, isn't that putting power into both sides??? On one hand this person had the choice to have an abortion, but on the flip side they regretted their decision, all I am saying is. Why should the laws change because some people regret having an abortion, while other people, (like rape victems or under aged girls) dont realy have any other options but to go through the abortion process  You have the right to your opinion, your body and your family.  You do not have a right to push those views on anyone else.  If you don't believe in abortion, don't get one.  You have no right to tell someone else they can't or push your views on anyone.  Pull your head outta your ass and worry about yours and let others worry about theirs. And she isn't brave, she made a decision and doesn't like the consequences of that decision.  Move on and don't do it next time. Where the bravery? She regrets her abortion? Where is the brave part?  Why do people care so much about other people's personal decisions? It's not your decision to make nor is it your place to tell other people what they can/cannot or should/should not do. Clearliquid- I could not reply to you directly so maybe you will see this.  Looks like most of my comments have been removed, when you say \" it doesn't have the right to use my body\", I disagree.  My belief is that unborn babies have rights, too. Why are we so involved in terrible things happening overseas when we are facing just as terrible things like this here (U.S) I don't think so.  There are huge psychological and emotional impacts from an abortion, not to mention the guilt.  I had one and could not have any more children.  I wish now I had that child.The clinic I went to offered no counseling or advice.  I think more women and men should be counseled on the possible lifelong regret that can come from an abortion."}, {"id": "a7urcv", "caption": "So cute", "image_hash": "22oerom8cd521.jpg", "text": " This is amazing  That smile could light up the world"}, {"id": "av41uu", "caption": "We dont deserve dogs", "image_hash": "a8vq1a8.jpg", "text": " We do, but you don't.

In Aroostook County, Maine, Marine fish and Game officer Walt Lawson is attacked and bitten in half by something unseen in Black Lake. Sheriff Hank Keough, Fish and Game officer Jack Wells, American Museum of Natural History paleontologist Kelly Scott, and mythology professor/crocodile enthusiast Hector Cyr go to the lake to investigate. A series of strange events occurs, including Kelly and Hank's canoe mysteriously flying into the air and flipping, the discovery of a severed toe and a severed moose head, and the decapitation of Burke, one of Hank's deputies.Later, as Hank and Hector argue, a bear attacks them, but a giant saltwater crocodile then leaps out of the water and drags it into the lake. Later, after finding Burke's severed head, Jack, Kelly and Hank witness Mrs. Delores Bickerman, one of few people living on the lake, feeding a blindfolded cow to the enormous crocodile. Mrs. Bickerman reveals that she has been feeding the crocodile for years after it followed her husband home. It eventually killed him. She is placed under house arrest for initially lying to the police.Hector decides to take Deputy Sharon Gare on a trip in his helicopter, and lands it in the cove where the crocodile lives. While he is diving, it targets him, but he and Gare escape. Jack and Hank plan to allow Maine Fish and Game to kill the crocodile when they arrive, but Hector suggests instead that he lure it out of the water and drug it. Jack reluctantly accepts the proposal, and they use one of Mrs. Bickerman's cows, dangled from the helicopter, as bait. After a few hours, the crocodile lunges at the cow. Hector pulls up, loses the cow, and crashes the helicopter into the lake. The crocodile comes on land and attacks Jack and Kelly. Kelly is knocked into the lake, but she makes it to the helicopter just in time.The crocodile then gets trapped in the helicopter. Despite Hector and Kelly's protests to let the animal live, Jack grabs a gun and shoots it. The gun is revealed to be a tranquilizer rifle. As Hector comes out of the water, a second crocodile attacks him, but Hank blows it up with his grenade launcher. Maine Fish and Game officers arrive seconds later. They load the crocodile on a truck and take it to Portland, Maine to figure out what to do with it. The last scene shows Mrs. Bickerman feeding bread crumbs to many baby crocodiles, implying the two adults were a mating pair. During the ending credits, the surviving adult crocodile is seen tied to the back of a flat-bed truck, speeding down a road. I should have read the title first... The picture reminded me of this  I assumed they were far away until I noticed the \"giant\" crocodile which was then confirmed by reading the title, d'oh! Gharial? Jesus is that for real?

I would give my life to stand 10 hours in front of this painting with nothing but a broom myself and just marvel at the subtle, but oh so majestic message this piece proclaims. Look at me! I can uphold such wealth and asserted order in times of crisis! I am sane! You are nothing to me! It makes us all stare in awe, can this be real? This piece broke every rule in the book in these times.**Look at where the observer is placed, slightly below her not perfect assymetric face, enhanced by the regalia in her nose, simply a white pixel is all there is needed to hint and establish that she does not care.. But does that matter? She's radiant! Her Crown, it's premium, half obscured by the strong, almost commandeering wing, ready for take off! Into where? The kitchen? More beer, perhaps? And then it strikes you, her crown says King! But she's a queen! Is he dead? Does he live? Is HE observing her? Subdued by her mercurial antics? Are we the observers? The dethroned ones! Oh! And,and, and.. just look at her white, almost spotless sceptre of cleanliness. In these times, cleanliness was simply adored and a must! Even where you wouldn't look was clean, toilet paper was sold out for weeks! But people were dying in the hospitals en masse! oh the inhumanity! Swept away and floating in the air, like dust falling onto cat litter.**The Scepter signalling control and utter dominance of ones domestic realm with the hand in steady guiding control, but look, the foot, ever so gently positioned on the broom, and far away from any face or center of this grandiose display, but at the same time it is the object closest to you. Almost in your face. A clever optical trick used at the time giving you the sense it is almost under your nose! What ingenuity, you can almost make out the user instructions on her feet scribbled wildly by a drunk mad man.**You are no match for me! Is chiseled into the entire piece. The ruler, draped in an opulent almost overflowing ,golden masked, heavenly blanket, almost cascading towards you. All of it just abruptly crossed by a bold white diagonal, a sort of anti-contrast, from the scepter pointing to the brilliantly half shown, half hidden, art behind her on the wall \"native birds of new zealand\". Are we but fragile birds in this tainted world, and that wonderful Rare Spotted Cat-fowl. Gazing defiantly towards the sun, or a fly, like Icarus, for ever pining for the sunkissed skies! Is it alive, is it dead?!**A staggering direct nod to the contemporary dire times, before it dawns on you! She's blocking the bloody door! You're not getting out of this, you're not! You're stuck in here with me, my little minion! For at least another two weeks! The plague has only just begun! Only the cat shall have freedom to roam, whilst you my puny viewer shall call for another pizza.**- Sir Rannulph Higginbottoms Buquet on The Domestic Queen Corona K Fisher by unknown artist* Bow to her!

Love it when purple with little to no experience with firearms make proclamations bad on no antispasmodic knowledge of handing firearms.

This guy has the shotgun at the ready, and he is flagging the protestor, and likely a lot of other people.If he was pointing it at this person, it would look quite a bit different.Now if this is in Hong Kong, then it is likely that shotgun did hey pointed at a protestor, which is awful, since the protectors simply wasn't to remain free. The irony in the States when it comes to a picture like this is that, the American left is anti gun, and pro - state. Meaning they want more government control, and when you give the government more control, it always ends up that the government tends to point its guns at the purple who simply want to be free.

To do so, add some hydrochloric acid (diluted to 10% v/v if liquid) to the system, slowly as to not shock the equilibrium.Also your free chlorine is through the roof, I'd suggest reducing input and potentially incorporating small amounts of an oxidizer (sodium persufate at ~45g/10000L volume) daily to help with cleaning up organics and reducing chloramine generation. If your chlorine remains persistently high, you can quickly force it down with sodium thiosulfateYour alkalinity is also a tad on the high side, but reduction of any bicarbonate additions by about 30% as well the addition of hydrochloric acid should reduce it to a more optimal levelYour UV stabilizing agent levels look good, but as you taper that chlorine level down, make sure to slowly reduce your additions of it as well.

You related to Jeff Dahmer? Meat is the tasty part of a farting machine. Overpopulation would be a large problem of we \"let live\" for many animals. I'm not talking about the mass production of shitty beef and pork, but deer, wild boar, elk . . . And unless you're a bad shot, you're not gonna trigger the release of those chemicals you talk about. Plants also have distress signals. While I do agree that overproduction is a problem, take your own advice and let other people live without forcing them to feel the way you do. You also probably drive a car and use electricity, no one is calling you out and telling you to bike to work and install solar panels on your home. im not sure they can be counted as \"someones\" if they're unable to talk about themselves in the 3rd person Save the plants, eat bacon.  Good that you recognize that. Plants almost have zero consciousness .  Most fruits are picked without harm to the tree that produces them. Most vegetable species produce many vegetables - picking them only strengthens them; the plant continues its life cycle and eventually dies. Grains are harvested only after the plants have reached maturity.Most important, there is no bloodshed or violence. If one thinks of one's own emotional response to fear, it is easy to determine that many chemicals enter into the bloodstream when one is afraid. When an animal is slaughtered, such a fear reaction is there, and then the person who eats that meat is eating those chemicals that, in turn, lead to heightened fright and flight response, tension and all kinds of disease...let the animal die, eat to your heart's content."}, {"id": "fo9xlr", "caption": "My son said hes sick of being in public  ; In the living room  .

Either take a little bit of pain or have a heat stroke I still have all my gear in the garage, but the thing that got me out of it was lack of players Its good for a lot. Critical thinking, getting out of the house and being active, team building, adrenaline. The only down side to paintball is that it doesnt come cheap. Here in Texas most courses have a 20 dollar entry fee along with you only being allowed to use their balls, which arent pro-level balls, that go for $70 for 2k. Thats like two games worth of balls maybe 3 games max if youre sharing with one other buddy.Getting a reliable gun that wont chop the ball will run you around $200, not to mention the tank, the air, the mask.

Tesla is clearly an innovative company that is smart enough to add unique features that show off the car in a way to make it look advanced. Why didn't you just say car? You sound like a douche saying \"my Tesla\". As noted in another response I felt that the manufacturer's choice in materials may have contributed to the visual effect I was seeing which is why I mentioned it was a Tesla. Because most cars wouldn't have such affect on water droplets, this is why you don't own a nice car.

He could save others, but not himself Yeah, that's exactly how fire alarms work.  The factory worker imbues a soul into a piece of plastic, and carefully explains to the plastic that the only thing that can kill it is fire.  So every time they see smoke, they scream.  It's pretty basic necromancy, but a lot of public schools skip that stuff. Heat rises, the difference in temperature between those two could have been 150 degrees. Oh man fires suuuck what happened Ya but to rise to that point it had to pass by the calendar? Or what a fire Not if the heat source were elsewhere in the house No doubt ? The biggest playing factor here is that the paper needs to reach a temp of 451F before it catches fire.

This would only really work if your trunk was closed off from the rest of the car. Or if you had a protective dog. Also a great way to get your dog or car stolen. You must live in a super safe area cause that car would be stolen and the dog the moment you go in the food store were I live For everybody saying that leaving your car open for your dog isnt a good idea, I agree. I just wanted to share this photo because its something I have never seen before. Yes I can see no possible downside to leaving your car wide open to strangers in public and your dog easily accessed by them too. There are no possible things that can go bad with this when you are far from your car and unable to see what goes on. Nobody has malicious reasons to enter your car or interact with your dog. My dog would just leave me forever. Yet I really wanna try it bc it looks very cool. And thieves with a moral opposition to animal cruelty. Dog AND car stolen. Its at a super crowded supermarket I think youve never seen it before because its just so stupid to do. I have multiple better solutions. 1. Windows and (if you have one) sunroof open. Not all the way open because then people can crawl in, but like each window halfway and the sunroof all the way if its there. 2. Leave your dog at home when you go shopping just like millions of other people do every single day. If you have a wrecking ball of a dog, put them in a crate or tie them up while youre out just like millions of other people do every single day. 3. Get it registered as an emotional support animal and take it inside. Even if they can stop you, they wont because of the PR risk. 4. If your car was made in the 21st century, remove the fob from your keyring, leave your car running with the air on, lock it from the outside with the fob and then unlock it with the fob when you get back. Im aware number 4 is also pretty damn risky, but at least now they have to break into your car to break into your car. If someones out trying to steal cars, chances are they can hotwire cars because its not like theres a lot of cars left running and abandoned everywhere, so youre still forcing them to do something loud and obviously illegal to get your car, unlike this guy."}, {"id": "g726pl", "caption": "Flower on a cholla cactus", "image_hash": "a133w4y45pu41.jpg", "text": " [here's some great footage of a cholla cactus"}, {"id": "c168fv", "caption": "Favorite watch  , hands down", "image_hash": "5d27xb4ndn431.jpg", "text": " They look to be to the side to me.

EDIT: I don't drive YET, this was just exploratory trip to a conversion van dealership.  I am not and will not be stopped by life and bonus for not waiting for the bus in the cold winter or rain or missing the last bus at night.I have a dark sense of humor and will often make jokes at my own expense, so if you want ask me about disabilities or accessibility or whatever. I don't know much but I'll answer what I can. I am not touchy. Yes I realize the first question will be about my dick. Yes I have one.I am trying to push the limits of what I can do on my powerchair as you can see belowMe in NYC for a couple hours with my aide and friend. It was ridiculously cold and the cops were out in force because it was the lighting of the Xmas Tree at 30 Rock. I am lucky to have a visiting aide that is a good person and we get along famously. She has very similar tastes in movies, food, etc. We hate the same people and finish each other's sentences. I call us \"an old Jewish couple.\"Bonus meme a friend made of me as Rick from when I first got the key for this apt. Bonus II: My powerchair is now equipped with LEDs like a-la NFS:U2. Cool right? Bonus III: Here's me shooting my instructor's AR-15 with a suppressor last year  Maybe an off question. But how exactly do you drive? It doesn't appear like you have the normal functionality to operate a vehicle.   While I know accessibility functions are around for little people, I am curious on what the work around is for your disability.  Congrats on the apartment man! I wish you the best and hope that the Van you eventually buy is badass :D User name checks out  Have you ever been Professor X for Halloween? Yes. I've posted from my main account a few times on such things as /r/raisedbynarcissists but I created this one after *clears throat* making some comments on less then safe for work subreddits. And I still wanted to share this but felt like I couldn't be arsed to go thru dozens of comments, and delete my posts, so I posted to my SFW acc. Bonus points if someone I know sees this. Not a question just wanted to say I dig the hell outta your jacket  Im happy for your increased mobility and freedom!

It looks so Skyrim. Rust is less dense, so it takes up more space. As a result, something can be covered in rust even if only a small amount of the iron has actually rusted.Removing rust can either be done chemically (I'm not really familiar with this, but as simple as exposing it to a chemical that reacts to iron oxide but not iron), or, when there's this much, it can also be done by physically chipping away at the rust, which can be done fairly easily since rust is much weaker than iron. I heard it takes a lot of praxece ENHANCE There ARE the rust removal lasers used by various industries to strip rust instantly and with no harm done to the part. For something that old, chemical or electrolytic rust removal could just make the whole thing crumble. The laser just removes the surface rust, and you can see on the finished product how rough and raw the iron still is. This was from a time before crucible steel was common throughout the world, and iron was wrought into shape and sharpened, hence wrought iron.  oh, YOU&#x200B;"}, {"id": "aljzd7", "caption": "my photogenic pup ness", "image_hash": "8u05knkzrnd21.jpg", "text": "  What kind of dog is he???

Back in the mid 1900's Biologists charted every nest on the coastline of an island by hand.

Many a personal pizza was earned through choosing my own adventures. Thanks for the trip down memory lane. My kids' school does this - read a bunch of books and they get a pizza hut coupon good for one personal pizza.  It's great, they look forward to it every time. Oof! Right in the feels!Just had instant flashbacks of Land before time, GI Joe and Rollerblades. They still have it!  My 10 year old has earned many pizzas through this program. And every time, I'm forced to purchase a large pepperoni and jalapeno pizza.  You know, just to support the program. I am a librarian. We have a pizza company here in NZ called hells pizza. They still sponsor kids reading with free pizzas. They even send a pizza truck to towns that dont have a restaurant close by so those who cant get to one can still get their pizza. As a kid I was a biggggg book worm (still am) we used to eat Pizza Hut once a week because I got through books so fast. What I really wanna know is why isnt there a book it program for adults and they give me free margaritas or some shit for my accomplishment.... Loved this program. I remember having to tell the teacher about the book to prove you read it.  I remember getting so excited over this one book that I wouldnt stop talking about it. Teacher finally told me to shut up, I know you read it. I was thinking about that the other day.  It probably wasn't that great of a deal for your parents.  I mean they still had to go to Pizza Hut and pay for a pizza.  Your little pizza was free but theirs wasn't.  Pizza Hut certainly still came out ahead."}, {"id": "e2wibr", "caption": "The Meteora Monasteries - Greece", "image_hash": "KgSqiEd.jpg", "text": " Was there a James Bond movie filmed here?

This is no different than than the current Congress - all one gender, all old, all wearing the same outfit.

So same ratio as Congress: I stand supported by your fact. I can name at least two genders not represented. Your assumptions about genders are stereotypical and passe. I think you need to spend some time offline learning from those around you. Maybe outside your comfort zone, if possible.

And here I was thinking the picture was the least interesting aspect of this post.All kidding aside, I live in a part of the world that rarely gets sun so seeing someone miss areas of their body with sunscreen is extremely common. I apologize for my comments but Im leaving the line above because I think its funny. Im impressed with your dexterity, I have broken one collar bone and dislocated the other shoulder so theres no way I could reach all of my back. Take care.

I signed up to a little painting class at our local pub (what a place to hold it!) this Tuesday night. Everyone buys a ticket  online, comes a little early if you want food or drink, and paint in a group circle with an instructor on stage. Almost didn't sign up because of nerves but this picture of your girlfriend's painting makes me glad I did! Maybe one day we could be as good as her! (Probably not though, she seems like a pro!!)

Designed by Miodrag Zivkovic and Ranko Radovic Materials used: poured concrete and rebar.  These old monuments are one of a kind and have a special vibe in my opinion. I love 'em :)  P.S.

I can see what you mean but what kind of park was it? There's community parks with just grass, tennis and basketball courts and a playground and then there are nature parks that are untouched by the city to let nagure thrive. That's common where I live although they have been redoing the trails and. We jist aren't allowed to go off trail because it's a natural habitat. The park it self is. The road is used to get to a water treatment plant that is behind the park It was a old kitty park with a playground. It used to have a jungle gym, swings and benches. They all rusted away or just got torn down. Only thing left is a single bench next to the edge of the park. The actual park was to the left of the trail in the picture Got it. Its sad that such a public place is abandoned.  Can you see the playground? That would be a cool pic to show the eerieness of it Ya it is pretty sad. It's now just basically used as a dumping ground for peoples junk. I couldn't personally find what was left of the old playground.

I worked at Microsoft, long ago enough that they still had this internal newsletter / thing called \"Micronews\". It had a classified ads section, for selling stuff (remember: pre-Craigslist, pre-eBay).One of the ads was for \"engagement ring, never used\".Saaaaaad. A close friend of mine and a member of our Friday Night Church Men's Group died recently. He was 80 years old and gay and had no surviving family. So those of us in the Card Party have taken it upon ourselves to clean out his condo. He was feeling a little sick and drove himself to the ER where he had a massive heart attack. It is so creepy cleaning out the house of a friend who left it with no idea he wasn't coming back. So many things that were priceless to him instantly become junk with that last breath, that last heartbeat. So sad. Oof. Brutal. Oh. Shes hot. Grab me that picture.

I read at one point this is why you don't see any nighttime photos of the Eiffel Tower.  (Working retail with a photo department, I wouldn't suggest having photos of your trip to Disneyland at least without the written consent forms that say you won't try to sell any of the photos.... Yes, they apparently have you sign something that your photos can't be for commercial purposes and that no money will change hands... Technically without this form we can't process these images.)

And at least if we can show some humor, personality/style to it might make things feels a little less scary at this time.

Every time you leave the house, interact with someone, dont wash your hands, or minimize this situation, its another bullet I have to dodge to stop my kids becoming orphans.Seriously. Stay the fuck home. God, my father is an Interventional Neuroradiologist. He ends up working on procedures in the ER a lot, on call. This is really starting to freak me out, and I'm starting to get worried about my dad. My city is being way too lax on lockdown procedures and enforcing quarantine and social distancing. Medical personnel are getting the worst of this, and I am so sad. What true, selfless, incredible people. I can't imagine what everyone is going through. I do food delivery, and have been blessed to be allowed to continue working, and I've been delivering to hospitals a lot recently, and all I can do is be as kind and patient to them and their sanitation procedures as possible. They all seem absolutely worn, and they deserve only grace right now (well, always, but especially now.) And once they were done applauding her memory, they went back inside to work some more. These guys are amazing. No hospital is giving hazard pay either. This hurts to look at :( these times suck This is so grim. Being a martyr for the American health system is garbage. How do we not have PPE for medical professionals. Its unreal. Im an ER staff nurse and have taken care of positive COVID cases. Im actually picking up as many hours as I can. I want to look back and feel as if I contributed as much as I possibly could. This makes me so sad. These people risk their lives to save others and have done an amazing job so far. So many have lost their lives to this and its sad to see that this has happened. We need our doctors and nurses now more than ever. If you know someone who is a doctor, nurse, EMS, Paramedic or any other first responders please give them the appreciation they deserve. They dont have to go into work to save people but they do, and some sacrifice everything to save someone else. They deserve the recognition for their sacrifice.

Its like going to a fancy restaurant and they serve you one corn chip with a smear of queso around the plate. Fun factThe extreme detour of the recurrent laryngeal nerves, about 4.6 metres (15 ft) in the case of giraffes is cited as evidence of evolution,The nerve's route would have been direct in the fish-like ancestors of modern tetrapods, traveling from the brain, past the heart, to the gills (as it does in modern fish). Over the course of evolution, as the neck extended and the heart became lower in the body, the laryngeal nerve was caught on the wrong side of the heart. Natural selection gradually lengthened the nerve by tiny increments to accommodate, resulting in the circuitous route now observed.

I can't figure out the TP panic...it's a domestically made product that is unrelated to any virus treatment, or prevention and there are numerous alternatives to use even if supplies run low. It's a stupid thing to panic buy. I'm about to legitimately run out of TP, and I don't know what I'll do. I have two little kids!! Bottled water, too. Do they think that tap water will stop flowing? Where is this happening? Should I be worried for the comfort of my anus in the days to come? There's no store that posted this notice . I don't know if the person that took the picture did it or some lowely employee that wishes to be unemployed but no store would make fun of their customers. I genuinely don't get the toilet paper hoarding thing. I went to the store yesterday and actually needed toilet paper because I was down to one roll. It seemed like there was less there than normal but  plenty to be had. I bought my usual pack of 9 rolls. The sanitary wipe aisle was 100% cleared out. It was like tornado came through there. Am I the only one that understands loading up on tp for this reason? I mean, I get it, its not 100% essential, its domestically made and the stores arent likely to run out- but what happens if you are forced to self-isolate for 14 days or more? My familys normal supply is a week, so 14 days wouldnt work. Also, what happens if you get 7 days worth, then get quarantined on the morning of day 7, right before your normal store run? Its not a bad idea to stock up on some things, and TP definitely makes my list. They're buying food, too. You only notice the toilet paper because it's one product in a concentrated area of the store. Toilet paper is just bulky so stores can only hold so much in stock.  The warehouses have the tp, it will just take a day or so to ship it to the stores.  All bulky items are like this.  All it takes to clean the shelves is a slight inrease in demand like folks deciding they will buy one extra 12 pack at the same time cause they may need to self quartantine... which is highly likely.  it's hardly panic."}, {"id": "byypqn", "caption": "He will ride eternal  , shiny and chrome  .", "image_hash": "guEhOra.jpg", "text": " S8.

We took him to vet to look at it and she decided to lance it, that thing must have been under pressure, because as soon as she touched it with the scalpel, it exploded so hard it hit the wall a good 4 ft away. After that, he was left with a hole like this. We called it his big, juicy hole, just to gross each other out. The major downside is that it itches while healing, so he would constantly try to get us to scratch it or rub it on us, I finally started using a plastic fork to, very carefully, scratch around his sore, that worked wonders. What was wrong with the little guy in the before pic? So happy he recovered. Cat bites can get gruesome when infected, luckily the treatment is easy and they recover fast. What a precious little cutie! Bless your heart for saving him  Opened the image without reading the title, at first glance I was very concerned why you added a picture of your cats gaped butthole, then it only got worse from there. Im happy your kitty is doing well, and not gaped... Cats are great. Not better or worse than dogs, it's just totally different game. I've always had good experiences with rescue animals.  I like to believe that rescue animals are ultra thankful and tend to show it.My brother 'adopted' a dog that was left behind a campground over a decade ago, and she's easily the best dog I've ever encountered (I know it's cliche 'every dog is the best dog', but I can only speak on my own experiences).  I truly think it's because she's always just shown gratitude for him ultimately saving her life. NSFW tag if you don't mind.  I wasn't mentally prepared for that first image.    Silver lining: eye bleach included. Your kitty is a fighter  wounds like that are caused from scratches from attacks.  A majority of cats get those abssess on their buttocks when running away.

I guess it can come across that way. \"come work hard\" $99 to just get them to come over to my house and then $/hour plus $/parts.A friend was quoted $1700 to $2700 from 4 different plumbers to replace 1 toilet that has a cracked tank. Quoted replacement is around $500-700 in terms of parts value... That was estimated to be done in 4 hours. Yeah.... I would definitely try to have my own trade business if I can do it all over again. Same here. I decided on IT. It can be interesting.

Is that right? If not then I guess the 'ball' structure would sort of explain the porous/rough feel of seemingly smooth chalk sticks.What is under it? With the holes.I always like these electron microscope pics but without context it can make things harder to understand. Looks like tiny coral. It's the shells of microscopic algae that lived in the sea a long time ago that built up over time as they died. Eventually those built up shells turned into a form of limestone. Well, no. No there isn't. Look all the patterns in nature are predicated on the laws and forces that bind particles and energy and shape their interactions- it's complex, but it's relatively easy to picture things basically bouncing around for a few billion years and making shapes. Life arising is also totally logical, if improbable. If you want to say God did it, I can't prove you wrong and wouldn't want to- but I find it hard to believe that a mind or a consciousness that plays pool with atoms and galaxies cares much about what animals are saying and doing what to whom- which is basically my problem with religion. It seems ridiculous to believe that a God that cares about our behavior also made leukemia and downs syndrome and nuclear weapons possible- and simultaneously made chalk atoms pretty just for the heck of it. It's simpler and more likely to me that order arises from bottom up and that our morality and choices are for us to figure out and live with. I am also amazed by the beauty and intricacies of the universe but why attribute it to anything? None taken. But if we're committing to the idea that only our own experience is valid, how do we know anything at all? You can't even form thoughts without language learned and meanings developed based on other people's experiences. It's not a leap to go from trusting other people to trusting science if you follow the logic and test the theories, but it's a massive  leap to go from raw experience to some sort of God IMO. I'd also offer that if you have experiential data that doesn't fit the standard model, form a new model and test it. That's science. I find that a lot more comforting than blundering about in the universe not trusting anything at all other than my own hunches. IMHO your logic is horribly flawed. If we didn't have science and its laws that can predict the behavior of the world around us then we wouldn't have any meaningful technology - least of which being the computing device which you are using to communicate right now. The existence of CERN itself is overwhelming proof that science works. Pretending that the small variations present in all observations renders said observations useless is insane.In your post you conflate scientific observation with personal observations/experiences. That sort of doublespeak may impress coeds and stoners but its simply not true. A thousand people can drop a regulation tennis ball at sea level from 1 meter and the results will be the same. If you wish to think that nobody knows anything and nobody can ever know anything then go right ahead. The rest of us will accept there are scientific laws and watch humanity discover even more."}, {"id": "c5zdeb", "caption": "A hawk mid-shit", "image_hash": "mijanm0sgp631.jpg", "text": " Truly majestic"}, {"id": "eolfi0", "caption": "The older school   .  .", "image_hash": "g86cv0y30ra41.jpg", "text": " I used to go there"}, {"id": "ao5que", "caption": "Im nervous about drinking this  .", "image_hash": "a7idber3f6f21.jpg", "text": " why are you drinking a mine ?

She is a rock star and keeps spirits high no matter the prognosis. I came home expecting to stay at home or in the hospital every day caring for her, but my incredible sister doesn't let her condition define her. We took this hike at sunset on Christmas day, it took all her strength, and I got this picture of her and her best friend. It gives me hope and it makes me feel strong, because of her hope and strength. Not sure if this will help or not but my aunt was anemic and what I found out from some one else helped her get her iron levels up, it's unsulphured Organic Molasses, it's super high in iron and you only need a tablespoon twice a day. Again, I won't claim it's a miracle cure but her body absorbed it much better and she said her doctor was stunned. Best of luck and beautiful picture &#x200B;[ Thank you :) we are trying all remedies from holistic to allopathic. Her condition seemingly stems from an autoimmune disorder, and will require a bone marrow transplant. While it's called \"anemia\", our true concern is her blood platelets drop so low she could experience an intercranial hemorrhage. My best to your aunt and others who experience anemia, it's draining and exhausting, and I hope many can benefit from what you've shared."}, {"id": "beup7p", "caption": "Insane camouflage  .

Totally. You can tell by the two dimensionality of the pic that it's real as ghosts don't appear three dimensional... Faaaaaaake Firstly, the image exhibits many similarities to images altered by \"Ghost Camera\" apps available for mobile phones. I would need to get a copy of the original image straight off the phone so that the meta-data can be examined, since a lot of the meta-data is missing, probably due to the upload process to imgur.You can just see it in this image, but enhancing the contrast shows that the \"ghost\" appears to be overlayed on top of the banister rather than only being behind it. This would generally indicate it has been added in post-processing after the photograph was recorded.Reference: I am a part-time paranormal researcher with experience in image analysis and manipulation (self taught). You can tell it's fake because ghosts aren't real. *unless.....* unless this was taken by the tooth fairy...

Wilfred soon followed - only to become wounded on the Western Front in February of 1918. Men from his infantry planned for this photograph to be sent to him while he was recovering in Paris.

Regrettably I know just how you feel as do many of us. We share your grief but celebrate that you had quite awhile with your wonderful friend. Im so sorry for the loss of your family member. He was adorable and obviously very loved. They just arent with us long enough  I'm so sorry for your loss. We just lost our dog last week.I know this is really hard, but know that he loved you as much as you loved him and you gave him the best life he could've hoped for.Rest in Peace Brutis. Thank you the support from everyone has been really nice while going through this. My husband and I cant have kids and we really are struggling right now. Im so sorry for you loss too. He died here at home, I took him to get cremated today. I asked them to save some hair and I saved some nail clippings. I was thinking about some memorial jewelry or something. I just didnt want to not have it and regret it. Im feeling really lost, he was my buddy, he was my bathroom guardian, he was my shadow, he was my cuddle buddy. Our little old man also died at home. We decided to also cremate him. We were given a little plaster ornament with his paw print.I know all too well what you mean. He'd lay outside the bathroom door when I showered. Sit outside with us and have morning coffee. Follow us all around the house. He just wanted our company.We're at peace with the idea that he's really gone now. One thing that helped us get to this point was looking at his pictures and realizing that he really was happy and we gave him a good life. Speak with someone and reminisce about all the happy memories and goofy things your little companion did.Sending you lots of love.I suggest you post over at /r/oldmandog . There are many there that will understand what you're going through, talk to you and hopefully help you heal.This was our pup Wrigley. Wrigley was so cute! You can see how happy he is!

It's confusing most of my students and a pain for me to correct  . I'm curious to know what others think about this  .", "image_hash": "MiVAtGg.jpg", "text": " How exactly does this work? I can't quite figure it out.  Its good for learning how to do division mentally, and not have to do the breakdown concept that you did. Its also a good way for kids to learn how multiplication and division are complementary. I learned the breakdown method, but when I do division in my head I typically do it the way it is shown to the left. Edit: While I realize I do the math in my head, I also round and estimate to numbers that make it less messy (no remainders etc...) Where do you get 60?  It's about learning why your're doing things.  It's not supposed to be the most time efficient method.  The point of these methods is to learn the relationships between multiplication and division and the relative relationships between numbers.The older method (which I learned) was fine for some people, but only because they were following the formula.  Most didn't really understand why they were doing things they way they were or what it meant.  The problem comes in when you get a problem that deviates from the strict algorithm that you learned.  You don't know how to deal with it, because you didn't really understand why you were doing what you were doing.The bottom line is that people learn in different ways.  The old method worked for some people.  They were able to follow the steps and get the right answer.  Some people even understood what those steps meant.  The newer methods are more verbose and slower, but that's not the point.  They're better at teaching the concepts. I understand it, but I dont like it. It works well with numbers that divide nicely, but I think it would be unnecessarily difficult to use that method if youre dividing by a number that results in a decimal.  Okay i am confused just looking at it. Just imagine who a group of kids just starting to learn this or going home to ask their parents which I wouldnt be able to help. When doing division in my head I've always broken stuff down into more evenly divisible pieces and then reassembled the results. I was never taught that method and I went to grade school in the 80s.It's always just made more sense to do it that way. The method on the left requires basic knowledge of mathmatics the way on the right involves tricks to help make the calculations easier by using smaller numbers. Just learn basic math, all those tricks and 'easy methods' actually make it harder in the long run. 150  3 = 50,33=1,Is that so hard?Random example2113= 70.33,2103=70,13=.33,70+.33If you need to make it easier,21010=21,213=7,710=70,70+.33And another one.1313=43.66,1303=43.33,13=.33,40.33+.33,This is what i do in my head. If it gets too complicated, you have a phone with a calculator. Edit: it looks nicer as i type it up. Added the comas to separate  Is awful and quite frankly makes it much harder for parents to help kids with their homework, because weve never learned this way of doing it. Its also time consuming. Multiplication, addition, and subtraction is the same way. Are they still doing multiplication memorization?

Wow how much time did that one take? Do you use an automated process to do the roads or is that by hand? Im wondering if you can make this by taking a tiger line file and uploading the road data into an automatic wood engraver thing. (Ive seen tools like this, but have no idea what theyre called.) Does everyone on r/pics make wooden city maps? I do, feel free to PM and I can give you info for my site. Nearly a week to draft the file, 30 mins to [laser cut it] ( but then another 4-5 hours to sand the main piece, \"mini-sand\" all the small pieces with a dremel tool, color all the green pieces, color the bottom blue, stain the frame, then glue them all back together. Some of the small pieces were quite hard to sand, if you lose your grip on them for a second the sander sends them flying across the room at mach 5+ speeds. I developed an automated model that does most of that type of work. A lot of editing needs to be done to it however to conform to both the laser's cutting resolution, and the density of the wood. For example, if you try to cut out really skinny roads/rivers it will just end up completely burned/ruined because the laser can only cut so thin. You can get a bit of a finer resolution with engraving, but if you try to do, let's say all of New York City on a small piece of wood, you'll just end up with a jumbled mess that doesn't look good at all. So you'll need to either scale your wood up or your cartographic scale down!It's quite interesting stuff. So that would make it a sonic street?

I begin to imagine how they looked in their prime and imagine how people were walking around going about their business so long ago. Gives me a very particular happy feeling, no idea why. I knew I should have gone for archeology as a career. I visited there a couple of years ago. They offer bus tours from pretty much anywhere in Mexico City, the trip was definitely worth it.Something you don't know, there's an exact place in Teotihuacan that if you stand and clap the walls will give off a bird sound, here's a video about it: Also, a picture I took from the top of a pyramid: Teh-Oh-Tee-Hwa-Khan If you go there, just outside the pyramid area there's a really cool restaurant called La Gruta inside of a cave. They had really good bean/tortilla soup. [ Someone photoshopped pit all the tourists It's always been my dream to go there. Landing pads for alien spacecraft! SO - true story.A while ago, I went to Mexico, and took a tour of these pyramids. I was at a low place in my life, and pretty depressed. So, I walked completely around the base of the big one, the Temple of the Sun. It's the one in the distance in this picture. It's about a 1/4 mile on a side.There are also those flat tables out in front of it, like in the foreground here.So, I am resting, sitting up against the one, and this wizened old vendor comes sidling up to me. I eye him, and smile. (Everyone smiled, almost all the time, when I was in Mexico. I really found that uplifting.)The man is carrying a black satchel. He says, in English: \"Senor, these are for your daughters.\"He opens it up, and there are these turtles, of onyx, turquoise and mother-of-pearl. They are a bit crude, but eye-catching. He has exactly the number of these that I have daughters.Now, normally I am thinking this is a scam, but nope. He somehow knew exactly how many daughters I have, and had that number of turtles. There were THOUSANDS of people in that place.  This guy just marched right up to me, and there we were.So, of course I bought all of them. They were not all that expensive.My daughters loved them.And, no evil spirits followed them home.[Me at pyramids]([Turtle (more ornate than I purchased)]([Shamans at Zocolo]([Me at textile merchant district](Edited to add link to the photos I took, and to add some context. r/powerwashingporn Where's the Kurast Bazaar waypoint?"}, {"id": "byhd1d", "caption": "My brother gave me his old sound system  .", "image_hash": "u03e82wrv9331.jpg", "text": " At least it was a dog and not Daryl again..

Welp, although it's not related to this picture, I'm currently researching Plasma Fusion in my university along with a team of great individuals who all hope to find a more efficient way to produce energy while having positive waste being produced by it, such as helium. Instead of the toxic and harmful waste some of the our energy suppliers currently produce. If you want to speak more about it you're more than welcome to PM me :D I am trying to do my part. I do believe that it is currently not too late to either stop or reduce the current climate change issue, at least that's what facts point towards. We all just need to do a little more, instead of just saying how it can be stopped. Also, Thor is the best Avenger no doubt. Pretty much Dominican Repiblic, off of a town called La Presa De Taveras. I wasn't expecting that much at all haha Got me, you're actually doing way more than what I do/could do. I am not that smart but, I always thought that volcanos power could provides us somekind of endless energy ( not so sure if plasma fusion and plasma volcanos are related but, thats my shitty link here lol ) And the last time I tried to buy helium ballons, the dealer told me that *the earth was kindof running out of it* - maybe he just wanted to screw me for money tho He was right, we are actually having a helium shortage. So in the future those super high pitched voices won't be achieved from inhaling helium anymore. I also don't think that I'm doing more than any else, there are many different angles on tackling the climate change issue. Even if it's just turning off your lightbulbs when you're not using them, or maybe walk a bit more to places rather then using your car if you live in a city of course. The plasma I'm referring to would be a scaled down version of what you would see that occurs in the sun's molecules. Basically two ions collide so strong against each other that they fuse and create an immense amount of energy. We can reproduce that effect with an expensive machine that hasn't been physically created yet called the tokamak. The energy ratios are insane, 1 litre of salt water would be able to produce more than 500 litres of petrol."}, {"id": "g65480", "caption": "Squirrel consuming food", "image_hash": "z0c6vcjxjeu41.jpg", "text": " Tree rat"}, {"id": "ahg1wb", "caption": "It wasnt easy  , but I drew the girl who painted the guy who painted the other guys mom", "image_hash": "5nna3sc8h9b21.jpg", "text": " what the fuck are those hands Very realistic.

So, technically the only word on the mug that would be subject to this rule is \"received\" and it follows it.  Now, \"caffeine\" might be an exception, but not in the form on the mug, when the suffixes are added, we change the long \"e\" sound to more of a schwa.  While there are known exceptions (mostly sciency terms), none of them are really present here on this \"clever\" mug.

Mycology is serious business; you don't want to eat a mushroom you can't identify with certainty. It also helps to include a picture of the gills (underside of the cap) if it has any. Spore color can also make a difference with some identifications. Pick them with the stalk an go to your local fungy specialist.Noteworthy: Fungus with lamella (as yours) have a higher risk to be toxic. Risk in pov that you might confuse the one you pick with another one. If you find some with tubes (e.g. Porcini) you're most probably on the save side. Heavy saturatuon on most of my pics (check em out please) and no I promise I didn't eat them. They look good though... even with out filters. Love me some mushrooms! Portabella, Shiitake, whatever. Little olive oil.. maybe throw in a little marsala.. boom heaven.  Make sure to also take pics of surrounding mushrooms. Good mushrooms can mutate from the spores of poisonous ones. I wouldn't risk it unless there's someone that gathers mushrooms frequently from that area.  Another thing: make the pic to be as close to natural as possible. This one seems to have been edited and has the saturation really high. I doubt it will be of real help since the colour are messed up.  Thanks for those additional tips!

Shame. Unfortunately he said that. Sad because after he got out from under the thumb of McCain he realized it was a lie. Nah its no dirt. It was either accept Trump or accept that the Republican Party was going to have a major schism. All the republicans came out against Trump, all of them, the ones running against him in the primaries were campaigning for other candidates who were semi-keeping up with Trump when they dropped out.Romney came back to the public eye to attempt to rally the base against Trump. Then we get that great photo weeks later of the two eating together and Romney looks broken.There were rumors that the Republican Party would use its ability to not accept Trump winning the primaries. Trump said he would keep campaigning as an independent and call for his supports to write him in, as he wouldnt be listed on the ballot in November.So Trump forces the RP to accept him, support him. If they dont they dont stand a chance to win the whitehouse. The party has a major schism between the various faction in the party, religious right, tea party, moderate Republicans, and regan Republicans, and whatever else. That basically lets the democrats have years of easy elections, and fundamentally changes the political landscape in the country.Four years of Trump and keeping the party together was the lesser of all evils for the GOP.

Tell me what's wrong with this photo  .", "image_hash": "8sircsn7dgo31.jpg", "text": " - PURPOSE: before anything else, what is your goal with this photo? What do you like about it? Why did you pick it instead of one of the other 50 photos? As you start to understand your own tastes and identify things you like and dislike in your own (and other's) photography, you'll develop a stronger eye.- SHUTTER: Use a fast shutter. The truck is slightly blurry which looks accidental. If you did a slower shutter, the truck would be much more blurry and it would look intentional. At night, even more so. But in general, sharp focus would look better. So if you speed up your shutter, there's less light getting to the camera so you'll need a wider aperture and/or higher ISO to compensate. - LIGHTING: Looks pretty flatly lit, so not super interesting. Light direction and the color the sun picks up from the atmosphere can add more interest. I bet this same composition would look really great right before sunset or after sunrise with light raking across the countryside casting interesting shadows. Depends on the direction.- SUBJECT: the truck doesn't feel like the focus and I find it distracting. I'd wait for it to pass and take another photo without it.- PROCESSING: a lot of interesting discoveries can be made in photoshop during processing. Push and pull exposure, add more focus, play with color, etc. Chevy can't handle that much of a load. Nothing \"wrong\" with it, classic rule of thirds composition, could use some filters to bring out the colours a bit more, I'd consider chopping the contrails too. You could use a polarizing lens to make the colors pop and the sky bluer instead of on the white side. The guys driving a Chevy thats whats wrong!!! I'm no professional but I feel as if the sky is too bright. In my opinion it pulls away from the color of the trees. Serious response: if you observe rule of thirds, recompose by cropping some of the sky to bring the vehicle to the intersection of the bottom left third will improve perspective and allow the road to draw the eye into the image... also an amateur, but thats my 2 cents.  I may ask you for the same advice sometime... Two things that I can see immediately:  1. The guy driving the truck is supposed to be home 'sick' from work.  Instead he headed to the lake.2. He is also wearing white pants after Labor Day. The dashed lines that lead into the yellow line... I win give me monies. That's a good check list. For me this photo's lighting lets it down first, no matter the other aspects it will be boring as you said it is flat. It looks like a photo to remember a place or experience, not a photo to capture a beautiful or striking image."}, {"id": "acqhf0", "caption": "Genderbent Jack Frost Cosplay", "image_hash": "u6ibjip73j821.jpg", "text": " Your feet are blue.

Aren't they end-to-end encrypted? If you're communicating over a third-party service who are providing the encryption, that third party is already vulnerable to legal requests from thousands of places.If you're communicating by providing your own encryption (e.g. OTR messaging, encrypted files, etc.) then it doesn't matter if they listen to every single byte, they can't know the content of the message, so it doesn't matter who you use to transmit that message.  The metadata in that case (i.e. who you spoke to and when) is almost entirely unavoidable anyway, by any medium, if you're communicating over the Internet.If you want privacy, don't use ANY mainstream service whatsoever.  Encrypt the stuff yourself, after verifying the endpoint is who they say they are.  And each endpoint needs to do both the encryption and verification and not be reliant on any intermediary service to do that for them.Been the same since day one of public key encryption.P.S. no government can \"listen to your calls\" or whatever if you're VPNing from one thing to another properly.

What does it say? Don't get me wrong, I'm no Trump fan.  But at least in this \"war\", the old are asked to give up their life for rich people. Its not die for your country. I signed up to do that if necessary when I was a young man.The actual thing they are saying is die for capitalism and the stock market.And thats not an exaggeration.Fuck that noise I would encourage everyone that isn't taking the coronavirus seriously to go get it yourself and experience what it feels like to drown in your own lung fluids. But I wouldn't do that because the poor doctors of this country already have too much on their plates. So just maybe find a different way to die honorably for the stock market. Your country depends on it, I guess. Not really trump literally said its time for the people and more specifically the elderly to make the sacrifice to help the economy recover From what I understand we cant determine it because only the rich can get tested or almost certain cases of corona as a measure to confirm, so if people get sick they go untested and if people die in their homes they arent being tested postmortem and end up having their deaths chalked up as respiratory complicationsAs of right now the global mortality rate is 3.4 but that may change because we are just in the beginning of this pandemic and this number is also taking into account that these patients are receiving treatment or allowing time to recover. Both of which may not be provided by the U.S. government. I think the mortality rate will be much higher in the States from a mixture of an unprepared and already unstable health care system, lack of response and now an contradictory response by our president and unwillingness to cooperate in this effort by the population. In China and Italy when they were at their peak the death rate was about 1 in every 3 and that is with (at least in Italy) an appropriate response rate and free health along with around the clock work from doctors in full hospitals while the rest of the population took up self quarantine and lockdown procedures.

I park closest to the outside but straight in and to one side so that another motorcycle can fit as well. Now that's consideration. I always try to park mine in smaller spots. One time Someone honked at me while I was getting my helmet and gloves on and leaving. I turned and it was a woman in a white suburban on her phone with her fingers tapping her dashboard. I know reddit hates Karens, and that may have been her name. So I turn back and continue and she double tap honks again. So I decide to take my time and finish that text, make sure my pack straps are adjusted, etc.  This is a particularly good parking space anyway. This whole ordeal takes maybe 45 seconds at the end of which she honks a third time and raises her hand like WTF?So I roll back and slowly roll out the clutch and putter away. In my rear view I can see her rev her car halfway into the space and see that I parked a motorcycle there because theres a big city tree planter that makes it a half parking spot. Shed stick out 4ft if she parked there. I dont know if she saw me but I gave a little princess wave as a rounded the corner. I'm sure his kindness will be repaid by one of the morons next to him knocking his bike over when they back out. Considerate for people driving cars, sure, but as a biker and tired of people bitching about my bike taking up *an entire space*, I look at that and wonder why someone cant share. Theres also the argument that someone driving a car has the responsibility to make sure the entire space is clear before pulling in, but eh. Whatever. I used to live at this apartment complex with terrible parking and me and a motorcycle owner would share a space day after day. I would leave room for him to pull in next to me and he would do the same depending who got there first. Never met the guy but I felt a kind of brotherhood with him. Have a bike.People still get pissed at you for parking like this.They get pissed if you park on the sidewalk.They get pissed if you park in crosshatches around corners in a parking lot that no one uses and just prevents cars from parking there. You can't win. Biker here, this is 100% not how you park your bike.  Yes, you pull out a bit so people can see your bike whilst parking, but taking up the entire spot while not leaving room for another bike is not cool. I thought you were being sarcastic, but then realised its actually a good idea. A Karen will still run it over to get into the space.

So Im guessing the black snake kills snakes that are more dangerous? The venomous is a copperhead.  The constrictor could be a black kingsnake. Interestingly, the country folk I know, the dudes hate black snakes but the girls seem to enjoy them. Not that way in Australia, red belly blacks are quite venomous as are eastern browns, so doesn't really matter the colour That's so cool!

Wife wasnt too pleased with baby snakes randomly coming out of the walls so she had to go. The aggressiveness is no joke.

Thank god somebody noticed :'( I don't understand people who do this! That's the exact same way we got our Chloe. In 1992, someone tossed an adorable puppy out of their car on Hwy 78 in Georgia, which is a busy-ass road. Someone saw her, slowed down, picked her up, and took her to a local pet shop that happened to have Friends of Animals there that day, doing pet adoptions. We arrived a few hours later, saw her, fell in love, and had her in our family for 14 years. People are asswipes. Straight up! Did your friend write down the license plate number? And to the people that take their unwanted animals to the country to abandon, there isnt some amazing bounty of food just waiting for the taking, or some poor farmer longing for a new dog to roam free and enjoy the rural life with him. They starve to death! Get mange and diseases. Attacked and killed by coyotes and other feral animals. Chase farmers animals and are shot and killed. So before you stupidly drop your unwanted puppies and kittens off because you were too lazy to have the parents fixed, take them to a shelter. Or buy a local farmer a box of bullets, since you didnt have the balls to take care of them yourself Im against animal abuse and littering, but its true what they say: One mans trash is another mans treasure. Those eyes!!! Thankful for your friend! Oh man. Reminds me of when i was driving to work in rural South Dakota, and I pulled up to this guy pulling a cat out of the ditch. I pulled over and asked what happened, and he said that one of the cars ahead that threw two cats out. One of which was run over by the guy (accidentally) directly ahead of him. The other cat that was in the ditch was still alive, but its leg was broken. He said he was bringing it to vet, and that was the last I saw him. Always wanted to know what happened there. \"and then, and then, and then that mean hoooman just trew me out the window\" Hopefully the truck driver will get what he/she deserves."}, {"id": "d4sss4", "caption": "My handsome big guy  !", "image_hash": "681zelm0kum31.jpg", "text": " That truck tho!!

Sure enough, here came 2 handlers, 1 with a cheetah on a leash, and a second with a dog walking down the ramp. Not something you see every day. Unfortunately, we didn't get a very good picture. The zoo is one of the things I miss  the most there, and especially the big cats. The newer cat enclosures are amazing. *until the predatory instincts kick in *meows*.Dog: Oh? Is that it? Nah, cheetahs are anxious animals and being raised with a dog companion like this settles them down and they become a family unit, essentially.

Definitely not Baker. Agreed on van rocking tho so many beautiful foul mountain views! I'm not sure which peak that is, but it's definitely not Baker (possibly Mamquam Mountain?). This is looking northward. Baker is most definitely visible from here if you turn to the south west, though! Ah! My orientation was wrong. Perhaps I was seeing what I wanted to see. I have fond memories of Baker, too. I think I see it correctly now, though. That forested patch on the peninsula is Stanley Park, right? Now I'm curious. Is that Whistler?

Those suspension cables don't look particularly stressed. I think the compression arch might be doing all the work here... It was a competition. This is what my team and I prepared. This was an experimental idea. You actually won't find a bridge in real life where both arch and suspenders are used. Since I didn't use a counter-weight the cables are a little loose. But prior to failure this model was able to handle 9.523kg wheel load. >You actually won't find a bridge in real life where both arch and suspenders are used.  That's not true! [Brunel has a lovely bridge down in Plymouth that uses both.]( Also [This bridge in scotland has both]( although cables hanging from a compression arch is not really the same thing.Actually, the main issue with your suspension is that there's no backstay to restrain the tower to. What this means is that your main towers are working in bending. Your tower bracing is not really good enough for it to act as a truss either which would have helped with the stiffness. So the cables just won't be picking up any load. In the first picture I think they are two separate bridges standing side by side. Look at the left end. There seems to be quite some distance between the two piers that are supporting two separate decks. And the second bridge is a typical arch bridge with a deck that is situated in between the rise.A suspension bridge is the one where load is carried by the cables which finally transmit it to counter-weights tied at their ends. The  second picture simply shows and arch bridge where cables simply transfer the load from deck to arch. You can replace these cables with steel beams and the result will be the same.As far as the towers in the model are concerned, take a look at their base. It is supposed to be a monolithic structure that acts as a solid base. The towers aren't supporting the load entirely. The thread actually goes over the top and is finally connected to the heavy base where the cable is actually affixed. Yes the towers will be under the action of inclined load but the suspension action is a secondary stabilizer. The primary load bearing element is the arch. You're making a mistake there. There are indeed 2 bridges in the picture but the nearest bridge, the old (though still in use) rail bridge is both a compression and suspension structure. In many ways it was Brunel doing the same experiment as you! You can see both the tension cable with its hangers and the tubular compression arch. Its incredibly well designed and can support loads far in excess of what it was designed for back in the 1800s>The towers aren't supporting the load entirely. The towers aren't supporting any load at all, unfortunately. Take them off and put another 9.5kg and you'll see it would be the same! The compression arch with the string spanning between the 2 towers to take the arch thrust are doing all of the work.&#x200B; My friend please search for truss bridges. In that find lenticular trusses. The bridge you are telling me about is an example of that. Just for clarification also look up the structural definition of all the 3 bridge classifications. Don't simply go for the looks and conclude, otherwise you will find it difficult to distinguish. Read this [text]( Actually the towers took some weight. I am sure because when we tested it to find failure load, one of the tower got crooked while others were straining heavily. The final result in this scenario was that the arch had actually failed first and the tower would have failed later. Maybe it was because we couldn't provide a proper grounding to the arch.  Dude, I don't mean to belittle you but I do have a masters degree in civil engineering and have been working as a structural engineer for nearly a decade. I really do know what I'm talking about!I have never heard the phrase 'lenticular truss' before and I can't see any reference to it from anything other than blog type websites so I'm not sure that its actually a thing, though if it is legitimate then I apologise and I'll have a look in my texts books when I get into the office tomorrow. However, the bridge does not share any characteristics of a normal truss structure and so describing it as a truss seems extremely weird to me. Trusses are constructed from parallel (or somewhere near parallel) compression and tension systems with loaded braces between them. [This picture]( shows a classic example of how a truss looks. Note how the cross brace members are the same as the main compression and tension members. That's because they're both taking the same magnitude of force. Compare that now to Brunel's bridge. The cross bracing is lightweight. It's main job is lateral restraint and picking up the deck, and not for resolving truss forces. The compression arch and the tension cable both act in unison and both pick up the deck weight. They also equalize out on top of the tower foundation removing the need for a cable backstay or a large masonry buttress.If your bridge loading as you say then I will accept your tower will have picked up some load. I was being flippant really. But the arch structure is clearly going to do the vast majority of the work. Oh no, I am actually enjoying this discussion. I too completed my master's degree in civil engineering in 2017 though it is in Geotechnical engineering. I am pretty sure Lenticular truss will not be mentioned in any of the traditional texts. Search in research papers in various journals.You are right, the traditional trusses do follow that pattern. This is my project way back from my first year in graduation so I don't exactly remember the specifics of a lenticular truss but I know we can't analyse it in a manner similar to a normal truss. The introduction of curved members means that a part of behaves like an arch. We will have to take separate components and individually analyse them by resolving the forces. The thing is this particular truss is difficult to make. The individual components as well as its complete structure takes too much time in its construction. So you won't find many examples of this kind of structure. There are some rare finds which have been replaced with more feasible designs as a whole.Yup arch is the dominant load bearer."}, {"id": "g2scxh", "caption": "Neighborhood Near Me At Dusk", "image_hash": "k745e0m47at41.jpg", "text": " Where the heck are you living.

I decided to put the kitten in a box as close to the other kittens as I could perceive as I was unable to get a visual, the briar is too thick. and perhaps the mother will hear the lost kitten.  I left for an hour to give the mother space to do her thing. I came back and the rest of the litter stopped meowing and the mother did not take the lost kitten. :(I tried delicately dig several holes into the briar with hope to reunite the lost kitten with the rest of the litter, with no luck. The briar is quite thick and I am tired. :( The mother cat will not take the kitten back, its best chance is to take it home with you or to a vet as the mother may kill it if she finds it Feed it the yellow of the egg mixed with water (no milk!) With a syringe (obv. without the needle) and bring her to a vet. If you happy to adopt: congratulations, you are owned by a cat now Wrap him up in a thin blanket or T-shirt (not too hot, you don't want to overheat him but do try keep him warm). Most pet shops in the UK carry special kitten milk with feeding teet attachments (usually between 8-12) follow the instructions on the box. If you have the means to advise a trip to the vet for a check up but there are loads of tutorials on YT about hand raising kittens. If you do not want to keep him or can't for some reason, contact your local cat shelter or put out an appeal on Facebook to see if a trusted person is willing to take them on Take him/her to the vet ASAP. Thanks for all your hard work, you did your best! That kitten is lucky to have someone that cares so much. You should post updates! But I'd definitely call a vet and maybe they can tell you how to properly care for them? Good luck! TY! :)   What ratio of water? I've nursed two separate kittens through the bottle feeding stage (two crazy stories) and I want you to know that it's normal for them to chew that nipple clean off.  Don't panic, but do be aware that those needle teeth will slice that thing in twain. It's a long time ago since I had to safe 3 babies. Not sure about the ratio anymore. Important is to feed them every 2-3h. With 3 babies this was a 24/7 job, we were 3 persons feeding them for 8h each.So go get help asap. There is special kitten milk that has all the incredients they need. You get that at a vet or in a petshop.Good luck and stay strong!"}, {"id": "ehogzq", "caption": "I don't know the name of this animal  , but I saw it in Barbados ", "image_hash": "5311nfnrvs741.jpg", "text": " \"Maras may even change their habits from coming out in day to becoming nocturnal, simply to avoid social interaction.\"Reddit relates.

My father smoked and after both my parents passed, we went in to clean out the house and the dark yellow walls and ceiling required a respirator to handle and even then we basically had to throw out some of the clothes we were wearing because we couldn't get the smell out. my grandfather was a heavy smoker and the tar literally beaded up on the walls, over 20ish years. eewww.  I cleaned an apartment for a man who had smoked for years.  I had to buy a razor scraper to get it off his mirrors.  I just wanted to throw up.  Dirty, nasty.  Stunk. I remember a pub in Epsom where the walls were a dark yellow from nicotine and the air was thick and oppressive (1990s before smoking in public was banned). It is clean, bright and airy now.  An apartment I rented for 10 years to a smoker was a nightmare to refinish. Every picture left a mark like a tan line. Absolutely disgusting.Another situation was diagnosing a friend of a friend's computer. \"It's overheating.\" The ashtray sat right next to the intake fans for its whole life. You could scrape the tar from the internal components with a toothpick, and it was thiiiick. Last time I did that. I'm on smoko! Leave me alone!! WTF they be smokin?...

If a person helps somebody, then let him brag about it and get some fake internet points. It's not like he's damaging anybody. Best case - he'll ignite followers to do the same (and more people will be fed). You wont find real heroes on social media, news or any other media where you can take credit for helping someone. Some people would call it win-win situation. Altruism is dead. Pretty much nobody does anything if it doesn't bring them something in return. Sure some do it for exposure. But I'd rather suffer those people than no one helping at all. His jeans should have holes on them. We live in a society. Why does Adam Carolla look younger than Lil-Dicky?

Rainbows are made by light being refracted through water particles in the air, so theres probably a lot of water in the atmosphere thats refracting the light. Either that or its a lens flare from your camera Those clouds are high in the atmosphere. The cold temperatures at that elevation make the water droplets in the clouds form into ice crystals that refract the light into rainbows like this. Wow. 6 upvotes in a few minutes. Thanks guys Bruh The 2nd was probably lens flare,i only saw 1 Ok, thanks, makes sense. But i thought rainbows formed a full circle. I also thought rainbows should be a circle because its a natural shape The shape of a rainbow depends entirely on the angle youre viewing it at& the only time youll see an entirely circular rainbow is from an airplane/very high altitudes because of your position relative to the sun. In this case, its likely that the two rainbows youve captured are both natural because of the order of the colours. The one facing outward has red on the outside and blue on the inside, while the other one has red on the inside and blue on the outsidethats consistent with double rainbows. With a little bit of research, I think that this rainbow phenomenon is entirely because of the angle in which youre viewing the rainbow. I thought about the angle after I posted the last comment.

Glad you picked up on that, that's exactly the look I was aiming for :) Digital paint technically, although I work with it much like I would with a traditional painting, that is I paint on one layer and don't use a lot of special brushes or effects, aside from some grain and curves adjustments at the end.The main thing was using lighter and lighter values as things got farther away. That alone already gave a feeling of fog and distance, then I just brushed on a light layer of white/blue in some areas. If I were working traditionally I'd do the exact same thing, and add a bit of a white glaze at the end.

Keep it up buddy  I have to start this off by saying that I am not the average human. I have characteristics that might be disturbing for many of you reading right now. I love the smell of shit. Every time I take a good shit, I put my head close to the toilet and take a good whiff. I prefer the feces long a stiff. That seems to have the strongest smell for me. However, this harmless quirk began to lead to an unhealthy lifestyle. I found myself going to the bathroom to just smell my feces. On one particular day, I managed to shit 6 times in one hour. I inhaled the perfect fumes that came out of the shit, but I felt quite weak. Shitting this much cant be good for my body I thought. I came up with a brilliant idea to solve this problem. I took a can of soup and gathered some of my shit in there. Now if I wanted to grab a sniff, I could just walk over and smell my can. The can system was simple as it involved me shitting is a can and replacing the shit every few days. I took the can everywhere I went and I could get a sniff whenever I wanted. I took the can to a nearby IKEA one fine day. I was shopping for desks for my PC. I also wanted a spot for my shit can on the desk that I was buying. I pulled my shit can out of my bag and started to place it around the desk. I did this to every desk that I looked at in IKEA. After looking at my third desk or so a worker came over and told me about complaints by other customers about my shit can. They said it literally smelled like shit. I understand that some people dont like the smell of shit, but people just have to deal with it. I have to put up with nasty perfume, cigarette smoke, and even weed smell at times. Shit smell is nothing different. It's not pleasant to everybody, but its nothing to lose your shit over. The worker nor the customer knew about the shit can, but just complained about the shitty smell. The worker asked if I had anything that could be producing such a repugnant smell. I showed her the can and she lost it. The manager came over behind me and started to yell at me for bringing shit into his store. He was scary and loud and it literally made me lose my shit. As soon as the manager came, I panicked and accidentally threw the shit onto a nearby desk. The manager was like, Great now there's poop all over a desk. In the can, the smell was somewhat concealed. However, the shit on the desk made the entire place smell like heaven for me. Everybody left that section of the store for around an hour and allowed for a cleaning crew to clean up the desk and spray something to mask the smell. Following this incident, the manager told me to wait as he called the cops. The cop came, and he thought the whole incident was funny. As he heard the story from the manager, he was doing his best not to burst out laughing. I explained that it was the manager's fault for me dropping the shit everywhere. The cop didnt want to hear it, but let me off with a warning. I still had to pay for the desk, but it wasn't the worst thing that happened to me in IKEA. Unfortunately for me, the manager ran my name through the IKEA system and found that I was supposed to be banned from all IKEAs ever due to my first incident there. I got charged with trespassing as a result of that look-up. I just wanted to shop at IKEA, but the manager decided that he would yell at me for my lifestyle. I guess that no more IKEA for me. It has been affirmed in federal court that people have the freedom to identify as whatever they please because of the first amendment. I identify as a person whose dick is also a person. Because of this, my dick also has human and constitutional rights. Since the first amendment guarantees the freedom of speech to all people in America, my dick has the freedom to express itself. Since dicks can only express themselves through nutting and pissing, the constitution GUARANTEES that I can nut wherever and whenever I want. Thank you so much :) U ok?

Now, I don't know if this is true in every SAR unit, but in mine, it's sort of an unspoken, regular thing we run into. You can try asking about it with other SAR officers, but even if they know what you're talking about, they probably won't say anything about it. We've been told not to talk about it by our superiors, and at this point we've all gotten so used to it that it doesn't even seem weird anymore. On just about every case where we're really far into the wilderness, I'm talking 30 or 40 miles, at some point we'll find a staircase in the middle of the woods. It's almost like if you took the stairs in your house, cut them out, and put them in the forest. I asked about it the first time I saw some, and the other officer just told me not to worry about it, that it was normal. Everyone I asked said the same thing. I wanted to go check them out, but I was told, very emphatically, that I should never go near any of them. I just sort of ignore them now when I run into them because it happens so frequently. Not gonna lie, if I came across this, Id immediately climb the stairs. There can be only one!!! Is this the staircase from Wynonna Earp? Yeah. Are you a David paulides fan?

Or, good job, bees, I guess. Congrats Fireweed? Thanks! We overwintered them last winter & they had a banner year! Thank you!  Free range, so a wide variety of plants including fireweed, for sure. What does overwintered mean in apiary speak? It means we didnt kill off the hive and store the equipment, like many northern beekeepers do, then buy another box of bees the next spring. Instead, we insulated the hive in-place, built a roof to keep the insulation (hay) dry, and the bees more or less hibernated through the frigid Alaska winter. Thats awesome that you keep them alive. I was not aware many keepers destroyed their hives before winter. I thought there was a population issue among honeybees. Why on Earth would bee keepers of all people destroy them on purpose if its possible to keep them alive during winter, especially in light of the population issues?Follow up question. Why do overwintered bees result in better honey? Does longer lived more veteran hives have better skills at creating honey than a younger hive? Does the honey creation skills get past along from generation to generation and improve with time?Sorry for all the questions, Ive always thought bees were very fascinating. Bees ARE fascinating!! Why kill the hive: Overwintering almost always results in mites - parasites in the hive that are tough to get rid of, which damage the bees as they are growing in the natal cells. It also can result in mold growth in the hive. Not only so, but sometimes the hive dies anyway, and all that work is for nothing. Naturally occurring pollinators are stressed - mostly due to monoculture and the pesticides that monoculture requires. But the honeybee producers have had no problem supplying us year after year. Im not sure about other suppliers, but ours has been reliable for our whole association (its called SABA - Southcentral Alaska Beekeepers Association) We might have had a good year even with a new hive. We had an amazing summer - warm weather, lots of nectar & pollen. Its not yet clear how big of a role the overwintering played in their production. However, our hive had more bees in it earlier in the season, which means more workers, ergo more honey. We had more bees left after the winter than we usually get in a package of bees that we would buy from California. Another factor that may have contributed is that they were all used to the Queen. When we buy a package of bees, they just dump a bunch of random honeybees in the box and add a Queen that has been flown (mated). We have to keep the Queen in a little box while they get used to her, or theyll kill her, because SHES NOT OUR QUEEN! The Queen eventually lays a whole generation of bees who are of her species, and her daughters are all familiar & loyal to her. She smells like home and so does the whole hive. Maybe the reduced settling-in time helped them. They were certainly a contented hive this year. Strong, happy, fierce, hard-working."}, {"id": "d5qvha", "caption": "waterlily", "image_hash": "p8up9uvnd9n31.jpg", "text": "  [  for all things waterlilies"}, {"id": "a6gglb", "caption": "Saw this cute little doggo running around outside  , luckily  , I managed to find her owner  !", "image_hash": "wwrmjbg8xg421.jpg", "text": " Awww.

You're asking leaders to shake their left hand with their neighbor's right hand. **That shit don't work either.** I know there is a running joke about him having tiny hands...Hes clearly afraid of labelled a leftist so hes keep a far right stance on this one. Only every other leader can have their arms crossed, do the math. The leader on the far right is holding the middle guys hand wrong. It makes no sense to someone who shakes hands every day. This is symbolic of the stupid globalist ideal that if we dream it, it will be. They probably don't attach a slick \"stable genius\" title to themselves, though. so someone being annoyingly confident in himself is grounds for dismissal of positives? this stuff is tired. i dont mind him as much as the next guy, and i also didnt like the nitpicking right wingers character assassinating president obama over trivial ish. having said that, the hamberders thing was *hilarious* No, his shit policy, a weak shortsighted economy, immense deportation, and an ongoing impeachment inquiry are grounds for a dismissal of positives. This is just funny because he looks like the fool he always insists on acting as. You should mind him as much as the next guy, but I understand the warm cozy appeal of centrism. I just hope you vote smart, it's all I can do. did you like/vote for obama? I did, yes. I was disappointed in parts of his policy, but I saw him as the better choice over McCain and deeply miss the goodwill his presidency brought the country. Before that I was too young to vote, but I supported Bush as my step father is a staunch conservative (and very eloquent with his stance).If this approach is going to degrade to attacking a now retired president, I'll respectfully pass. I believe I had the intelligence and knowledge needed to supply my vote then, and my adherence to that level of candidate investigation led me to believe Donald Trump is a dangerously unfit leader who physically cannot cross his hands over his body. No politician is perfect, but Donald Trumps tenure as president has been, as a resident of Washington DC (Alexandria, technically), an absolute shit show the likes of which I have not seen before. After several discussions about it with my step father, a retired lt. colonel and former lockheed martin executive, I still feel my opinion towards the current president is validated by what arguments I've been shown.Anyway, yes, I'm a democrat.

I've saved several snapping turtles from the road over the years, and they don't like it at all.  \"stop trying to bite me, I'm saving your life\" I had one of those as a pet when I was a kid they're an alligator snapping turtle. Thats a baby snapper! Didnt know their tails were as long as their shells when theyre young [He's a youngster.](I once carried a grumpy 16\" long snapper off a busy road near a swamp one sunny spring day here in Wisconsin. One tap on his shell to get him to retreat inside then I grabbed him by the sides and ran him like I was carrying a landmine. Set him down by the edge of the swamp and he slowly walked away.It wasn't until later I discovered holding them by the sides is no guarantee they won't bite you. One more example of why you should leave snappers the fuck alone. Is it dead? We need more information! Poor little fellow When you find these guys it is usually best to keep them for about 6 months until they have a shell length of about 5-6 inches as it GREATLY increases their survival rate. As is this little dude has a 99.9% chance of dying before becoming an adult, at 6 inches that drops to only a 14% mortality rate. Of course getting them to whatever water source they are going for is the next best thing you can do, but all to often it just ends up being a fish buffet, where a single bass will eat a couple dozen of the little guys in a single sitting. what a moron i would have stomped it to teach it to not be such a moron i hate turtles though their so stupid!! Did you name him \"Lil Bitey\"? This one is a common snapping turtle, If yours had a long neck it was a common snapper. they actually make pretty great pets so long as you watch your fingers, and can afford a tank big enough for them.

Reddit is banned in China so this is further adding to their theories as why would a Chinese company invest in a platform not usable within its country. But honestly if reddit were to take part in something like that it would just drive the users elsewhere inevitably shooting itself in the foot. But hey, lets get our pitchforks.EDIT: To add, I dont know if reddit is ACTUALLY banned in China, the point is, the vast ammount of sites, like the following, saying it is, is doing nothing more than fanning the mob mentality of the theory of censorship.

There is an also Xcel-owned coal power plant just 3 miles from it, and that one has two stacks. You might have mixed them up. I could very well be mixed up. I just know the gate says nuclear plant. Obviously I'm not an expert on the field so I just read the signs. :-) When you say you know the plant, are you from the area or do you work in the industry? [I made a marked map with zooms.](The nuclear site has just the one thin ventilation stack that looks very different. You won't really see condensation coming from that. The coal plant has the two large chimneys.You might be driving by the nuclear plant's gate and then soon after seeing the chimneys on the right, and thinking they're the same site, but they're two separate sites."}, {"id": "chc2kp", "caption": "I wonder what happened to the rest of this boat  .", "image_hash": "0ldl6ccmpac31.jpg", "text": " Camouflage level: 0 That's a cool boat though.

This is a little bit late, but may I just say thank you. My father received a kidney donation almost 30 years ago, and due to this I had the privilege of not only being born but spending 17 long years with him prior to his passing. You may think that you have saved a life, but you have done more than that. To the recipients family you have given an average of 20 more years with the person. Thank you OP. Very much at peace with the decision. I felt it was the right thing to do. Also a very effective weight loss technique.In all seriousness - we'll done. Wonderful thing you've done. Meh... I donate kidneys all the timeAnd I'll continue to do so until someone finally asks where I get them all. You are amazing. My brother was blessed by a woman just like you. Good to see good. My girlfriend had a kidney transplant almost 6 years ago she has PKD.The only person that tested was a match what are the odds?    They just took her native kidneys out a month ago, shes doing good but lost a bunch of weight.  Hats off to all those that donate organs! This gives me hope. My Mother has a terminal liver disease. Im terrified of the prospect of being a live donor. It wont be for around 5 years yet, but I am very nervous at the idea. How did you feel going in to it? Spent a day learning as a donor myself.  99% of all US donors have had zero major issues after donating, 98% would do again (n=250,000+ donors).  Also zero cost to donors and if anything happens that requires a kidney transplant, donors immediately go to the top of the national donor list by law.Dialysis is awful.  And average lifespan after starting dialysis is around 5 years.  Save a life!  Donate a kidney. As someone who was born with a defective left kidney and had to have it removed at 19 as it was basically non-functioning, I have a mountain of respect for you to go through this to help someone else. That procedure was painful and not easy at all.

Looks like a rock from a climbing wall. They usually have a through hole so they can be bolted to the wall and removed, replaced, moved... 2 explanations.1. it's an adder stone, also known as a witch/ hag stone. Not sure that's the right rock for that. Rocks with natrally bored holes in them is a thing though.2. It's a broken brick that has been eroded smoothing out the rough broken edges as you said. It's likely as you can see the remnants of the middle hole. No, this is a smaller Creek and there weren't any cars or vehicles nearby. The only other people there were the occasional biker or jogger. Not to be nosy, but why do you ask? It's not, the hole goes all the way through where as the rocks from climbing walls usually have something for the bolt to catch on. Also, if you see the other side it is a bit more jagged, there were also other bricks like this one in the creek. Aren't they usually a form of epoxy? Sometimes they can be very stiff rubber.You'd also want to have 2 anchor points as you wouldn't want any sudden loosening to cause the peice to rotate like a door knob.Then again I don't climb recreationally maybe they do have whacky twisty parts, sounds like a bad idea to me. Yeah, it's a brick. The thickness and nearly symmetrical hole show that it was a brick.

As I was scanning the coast for some cool angles etc, I saw this group sunbathing on this huge rock. It was clearly a meeting point as there was a lot of traffic to and from this rock. It was fun watching them for a bit. The whole trip was beautiful, and this was a bucket list photo for me because of the color of the water and wildlife in natural habitat.

Worldwide, songbird populations have taken, and are taking, a dramatic decline - and it's happening on our watch.The reasons are not entirely understood or agreed upon. However, it seems clear that the biggest culprit is the use of pesticides, both in commercial and residential applications.Other important factors are loss of habitat, and (it's true) housecat predation.Do your part. Here's a few ways that will help:Find non-chemical, non-poisonous ways for pest control - if it kills moss or ants or mice, then it's going to help kill you and your loved ones, too.Plant native plants that will attract and feed songbirds. Less lawn, more trees and shrubs and wildflowers. Pull weeds by hand. Less lawn fertilizers, including weed and feed types.Support organic farmers. Buy organic whenever possible.Keep Fluffy indoors, or at least put a bell around her neck. Cats are the most popular type of pet in America. Their cumulative damage to bird populations is staggering. Have your cat spayed or neutered to help control feral cat populations.Stop buying Roundup. Controversial stuff, has huge corporate ownership and funding behind it, fighting for it. It is everywhere, and there is strong evidence that glyphosate (the active ingredient in Roundup) is harmful - perhaps even lethal - to yourselves AND everything around you. In the US alone, we've lost 30% of our songbirds in the last 45 years. (About the same time Roundup hit the market - hmm.) Don't let this eradication continue on our watch. Do your part to support the birds!"}, {"id": "c1rdpd", "caption": "I do murals roo", "image_hash": "jqzzonpupy431.jpg", "text": " cool artstyle"}, {"id": "bdueva", "caption": "Twins reunited", "image_hash": "65JHxDW.jpg", "text": " Do you know them?
