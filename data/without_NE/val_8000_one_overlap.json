I heard him up late working in the garage one night on something, so I sneaked in to see what it was.  He was engraving words on a piece of wood.  I got closer and closer to see what it said, and when I could finally make out a sentence or 2, he heard me coming.  It surprised him, and he spun around and said, \"Don't you ever sneak up on me like that again, you little bastard!\"  Then he grabbed some jumper cables and proceeded to beat the living shit out of me. These mustve been advertised on Facebook or something. I got a very similar one from my dad a few weeks back. Hes terrible with words so I knew he didnt write the inscription, I appreciate the sentiment all the same though.

I'm glad all turned out well and you were able to catch this one before it became a bigger problem. Thanks for the warning. When you looked it up, is it just the brand or the actual type of bulb that is causing problems?These type of bulbs became the new norm from the old style bulbs and I cannot imagine how many people have these in their houses. I picked my son up from school and he went downstairs to play. About five minutes later I went down to check on him. I never do this, hes big enough to play alone for hours and he checks in. So, I go downstairs and something smells weird. I almost dismissed it thinking the heater smelled funny again and I wanted to sit down.  I start looking around and there is wisps of smoke along the ceiling. I trace the smoke back to where it started and found this.  turned the light off fast to stop the burning and then replaced the bulb. Looked it up and these bulbs start fires in houses easily! I send the picture to the landlord and he comes here from work with 40 new light bulbs and changes out every light bulb like this in the house!   The smoke detectors never went off but by chance I found it before it became a structural fire. If you have these in your house, do your research and swap them out!! That seems to be relatively common among CFL bulbs, or at least the earlier types. You could hear them pop. Wow. Never happened to me, but we were slow to use them. Now new lightbulbs are LEDs. Thank you! I didnt know about it but the internet says CFL bulbs have very specific ways to use them and most people have them places they shouldnt be. Thats true of what we had here. Its called a CFL bulb. These cant be in recessed lighting fixtures or covered light fixtures because they get hot and need to breathe.  All of ours were recessed or covered. You can google CFL bulb dangers or CFL bulb housefires which is what I did to find the articles. If he's big enough to play for hours and check in. Then why after 5 minutes did you go downstairs to check on him? I was thinking you were going to add a reasoning... But nope, you left us hanging. Maybe mother's intuition? That would have been pretty cool to say. I did read they can explode! Luckily it didnt do that. This one was smoking and melting but it had just started to turn into fire when I found it. After we replaced the bulbs there were two or three more that had brown marks from being too hot. They should never be used in things like recessed lighting, enclosed fixtures or direct contact fixtures (wall/ceiling mounted). I use them in well insulated free standing lamps and my ceiling fans with open globe lights but I'm only using them until they are gone.

Personally Ive seen people being kind as a big one, but also love the idea that less folks are driving to work and helping the environment. Totally agree. Seeing the pictures of how nature is slowly regenerating in just a few weeks of less human presence is so insane.

Agnes Kasparkova is a 90-year-old former agricultural worker who picked up a new hobby in her retirementpainting.> Kasparkova uses her spare time to paint traditional Moravian motifs in bright blue-ultramarine across the walls of Louka's buildings. A favorite space to paint is the village chapel, which gets annual touch-ups by the artist, as she springs up on the scaffolding and paints a flowery motif across the facade.> Using her imagination, she doesn't plan out her work in advance, letting her brush and fantasy decide the final results. Previously, other women painted the white Moravian houses, passing down the tradition to Kasparkova. And though she pauses in the winter due to the cold climate, as spring arrives she continues beautifying the village. Her work is similar to the painted houses of Zalipie, with their colorful flower garlands, and reminds us that you are never too old to demonstrate your creativity.[Here]( is this work of hers on Google Street View.In [2017 she was 90]( My grandmother stopped painting in her late 80s because her eyesight was going and she couldn't get the details right. When she was 92, my mom sat her down and made her pick the paintbrush up again.  She was so happy again and continued painting for the rest of her life.

OP, can we get more of the story? Did the sheep tell you that?  Excepting that wolves have a social structure and share among themselves fairly freely so long as there is enough to go around.The dog is as out for self as the wolf is. The wolf succeeds, it gets to feed its family. The dog succeeds... it gets to feed its family. That's all the dog is thinking. \"Alpha has included these in the pack. I will protect them.\" Dogs are wolves bred not to fear humans. There is little difference between the two other than the interference of humans.
